		<name>San Francisco Rush : Extreme Racing</name>
		<desc>San Francisco Rush Extreme Racing for the PlayStation is based on the 1996 hit arcade game by Atari Games. Players will race through locations based on San Francisco cities, rural areas, and suburban neighborhoods. Environments can also be cycled through day, night, and snow conditions in order to add some variety and challenge to the racing action. Players can alter their view of their car from a third-person perspective to a first-person view looking through the windshield. There are eight available cars to choose from that vary in speed and control as well as four difficulty levels (Beginner, Advanced, Expert, and Extreme). The higher the difficulty, the more control is sacrificed in order to increase the maximum speed. Car colors can also be customized to your liking, and there is a choice between manual and automatic gear transmissions.</desc>

		<name>Need for Speed II</name>
		<desc>Take control of eight Super Cars and race your way through six different tracks from Australia to Nepal. Much like the first in the series, the sequel has plenty of high performance cars to choose from, including the McLaren F1 or Ferrari F50 and a few concept cars, each handling differently. Once you've beaten the six tracks, a new track is available to you. It's a fast paced racing game which is intended to play more like an arcade racer than a true simulation. The main difference between this and the previous Need for Speed game is in the tracks, with less open road tracks in this sequel. Also, there are no cops to chase you. However, the tracks available are have a range of detail, and some have changing weather conditions while you race.</desc>

		<name>Worms</name>
		<desc>Worms é um jogo de estratégia baseado em turnos. O jogo possui máximo de 4 times com até 4 "Worms" cada e o objetivo de combater no estilo time x time em um terreno randomicamente gerado. Cada worm tem 100 pontos de vida, e morre ao atingir 0. Ao morrer, o worm explode e acaba causando dano a todos que estiverem perto. A jogabilidade é baseada em turnos. Cada turno um jogador pode controlar um worm de sua equipe. Cada worm pode se mover para a direita, esquerda ou pular. Contudo, há um limite de tempo para que o jogador faça o movimento; caso o worm caia de uma grande altura, perderá vida e o turno terminará imediatamente; se o worm cair para fora da tela de jogo ou na água, morre imediatamente. Cada turno um worm pode fazer um único ataque; o jogador pode mirar para cima e para baixo, escolher a arma e então atirar. Após atacar, o turno acaba.</desc>

		<desc>Three weeks after the Eurasia space colony incident, the Earth's surface was severely damaged and humans were forced to flee underground to escape from the planet's severe pollution, and Zero is still missing, presumed to be dead. Reploids were sent in to terraform the land in an attempt to make the planet habitable for humans once more, however, a Reploid and former colleague of Alia named Gate discovered something unusual amidst the ruins of Earth — a piece of Zero's DNA. After examining Zero's DNA, Gate became mad with power and an outbreak of bizarre Mavericks occurred. Weeks passed, Isoc, a Reploid scientist and an associate of Gate, announced to the people that a new phenomenon known as "Nightmare" has quickly spread throughout the world, causing Reploids to hallucinate and eventually destroy themselves. Isoc suspects the cause of the outbreak is none other than Zero who been spreading the phenomenon as he goes, much to X's anger and confusion. Isoc rallies Reploids throughout the world to aid the Nightmare Investigators, led by the powerful High-Max, at key locations to track down the source of this new phenomenon as well as Zero. X, along with the Maverick Hunters, must confront the Nightmare Investigators as they try to solve the mystery behind the Nightmare Phenomenon and clear Zero's name.</desc>

		<desc>MDK is a 3rd person action/shooter game in which the objective is to basically shoot everything that moves in six massive cities, each with their own sublevels. Because the world is being invaded by aliens, it is up to you and your sidekick Bones to stop the invasion and single handedly save Earth. In order to do so, you must make good use of your special suit, which allows you to do all kinds of things. The super-suit comes equipped with many features you'll need to utilize in your journey, such as the sniper helmet. This allows you to zoom in on unsuspecting enemies and fire off shots with pinpoint accuracy. There is also a built in parachute (a ribbon-like device) that enables you to glide between different platforms as well as drop down on intruders. Your suit comes equipped with a chain gun that has an infinite supply of ammunition. You can also pick up special items, like a miniature nuclear bomb and powerful upgrades for your chaingun. In addition to running around and shooting, there are also special means of transportation including a surfboard-like jet and a bomber plane that is used to call in air strikes.</desc>

		<desc>G-Darius revolves around a conflict between the humanoids of Amnelia and cyborg/chimera biovessels known as the "Thiima" (meant to mean simply "bringers of death"). The Thiima had been aroused by the Amnelian army's use of the weapon A.N. (All-Nothing) to annihilate the world Blazar, whom Amnelia had been at war with over jurisdiction over the moon Mahsah. Determined to protect their existence, and long ago programmed to protect the universe from just such threats as A.N., the Thiima swarmed on Amnelia. Although the armed forces were badly ravaged, Amnelian scientists and engineers were able to make use of both A.N. and reverse engineered Thiiman technology/life systems to create the Silver Hawk fighters. Ultimately, two pilots "Sameluck Raida and Lutia Feen" are chosen to perform a decisive attack on the main Thiima base: Kazumn, a satellite of the planet Darius.</desc>

		<name>Space Invaders</name>
		<desc>In 1978, Earth successfully repulsed an invasion from outer space thanks to "the Tank." The Tank was based on alien technology found when a scout ship had crashed years earlier. Now, over 20 years later, a new Tank has been created based on the technology recovered during the 1978 invasion. And none too soon, because the Invaders are back! Space Invaders is yet another classic arcade game remake by Activision. (See Battlezone and Asteroids.) But this time, Activision licensed a game from Taito instead of Atari. The game stays close to its roots while adding many power-ups and enemies. You can play either one or two players against the Invaders, who march down the screen in orderly rows and columns, at one of three skill levels. You'll start at Pluto and work your way through the Solar System to Mars, then Venus, and finally Earth. There are four common aliens (red, green, blue, and yellow), plus seven more less common ones. You receive special one shot power-ups by shooting four of the same type of Invaders in a row. As in the original game, there are also Mother Ships that fly above the action, but in this version if you hit them you can pick up other useful power-ups like shields or double shots. Plus, after fighting off several waves on each planet, you'll face a unique boss. If you manage to finish the game, you'll be able to play a reproduction of the original coin-op.</desc>

Com o passar dos anos, Selene se torna maior, mais poderosa e mais independente da Terra - até o ponto em que a Lua e a Terra lutam em uma guerra que termina sem uma vitória definitiva para nenhum dos lados. Em 2242, a guerra irrompe novamente - a Terra lentamente começa a ganhar ... exceto pelos esforços de uma tecnologia experimental Selene conhecida como Einhänders: máquinas voadoras com uma "mão" que lhes permite mudar de armamento no meio da batalha. Em 12 de dezembro de 2245, Selene envia 3 Einhänders em uma última tentativa de virar a maré da guerra. Você pode escolher a nave para pilotar, e cabe a você lutar contra as monstruosas defesas da Terra e vencer a batalha. O jogo é um shooter de tela lateral, com fundos 3D renderizados e inimigos. A atmosfera do jogo é muito "industrial", até a música industrial alemã tocando ao fundo. A troca de armas e a reivindicação são parte integrante do jogo, já que as armas têm tiros limitados.</desc>

However, humans quickly began to fear and distrust Repliforce's military power and their methods of fighting Mavericks proved to be very destructive with little disregard for human life. One day, the floating city Sky Lagoon was under attack by Mavericks and Repliforce arrived on the scene after the city has crash landed on the ground, where one of their leaders, Colonel, was being ordered by the Maverick Hunters X and Zero to lower his weapons for questioning as suspects for the incident. Out of pride and contempt towards human government, Colonel refused to comply, and following the accusations behind the Sky Lagoon incident, the Repliforce General decided stage a coup d'état, seeking to create a new utopia just for Reploids. Repliforce were then labeled as Mavericks by the government, thus the Maverick Hunters must fight against their former allies and stop their coup.</desc>

		<name>Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six</name>
		<desc>Using a Tom Clancy storyline and characters, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six for the PlayStation is an original first person 3D shooter where you take control of an elite counter-terrorist organization named Rainbow Six. After selecting one of three difficulty levels (beginner, intermediate or Special Forces), you select a team of operatives from a full roster. You can also equip your team with the appropriate weapons and equipment based on real-life munitions (even in Sniper Mode). To further realism you can select where each team member begins. After planning, lead your team into the mission where you get to control each member, one at a time. Also, as in real life, one shot may often maim or kill your operatives. If all of your operatives are killed, your mission ends. You must then choose to either move on with new operatives or retry the mission. If you complete all of your objectives you move on to the next mission for a total of 14 different missions in real world locations. In addition to the regular missions, you are also given the option to train. In the training level you can practice controlling an operative in a non-threatening environment. This is where you really get to learn some important skills. There is an assault course, a shooting range, and a training mission. Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six includes many real-life weapons. They include guns, grenades and kits. Some guns include: the HK MP5A2, the preferred submachine gun of counter-terrorist operatives around the world; the CAR-15, a compact M-16; and the Benelli M1, a good tactical shotgun that is an essential weapon for many teams. Other weapons include Frag Grenades, Heartbeat Sensors and Demolition Kits. Uniforms are another essential piece of equipment for counter-terrorists. Some include the ever-popular light, medium and heavy uniforms, the desert uniform, and the Camo uniform -- all used in different environments. The game also features real time lighting and special effects for ultimate realism.</desc>

Reploids were sent in to terraform the land in an attempt to make the planet habitable for humans once more, however, a Reploid and former colleague of Alia named Gate discovered something unusual amidst the ruins of Earth — a piece of Zero's DNA. After examining Zero's DNA, Gate became mad with power and an outbreak of bizarre Mavericks occurred. Weeks passed, Isoc, a Reploid scientist and an associate of Gate, announced to the people that a new phenomenon known as "Nightmare" has quickly spread throughout the world, causing Reploids to hallucinate and eventually destroy themselves. Isoc suspects the cause of the outbreak is none other than Zero who been spreading the phenomenon as he goes, much to X's anger and confusion. Isoc rallies Reploids throughout the world to aid the Nightmare Investigators, led by the powerful High-Max, at key locations to track down the source of this new phenomenon as well as Zero. X, along with the Maverick Hunters, must confront the Nightmare Investigators as they try to solve the mystery behind the Nightmare Phenomenon and clear Zero's name.</desc>

		<desc>A terceira parte da série Toshinden. Após a derrota da Sociedade Secreta no Arena de Batalha Toshinden 2 surge um novo grupo de bandidos. Conhecidos como Organização, eles desejam usar os lutadores Toshinden como sacrifícios de sangue por um ritual para convocar seu deus obscuro. Dos 15 personagens criados do Toshiden 2, agra são 32 personagens neste novo Toshiden! Destes, 14 são lutadores iniciantes, 14 membros da Organização e 4 chefes. Embora muitos dos membros da Organização tenham listas de movimentos próximas ou idênticas ao seu personagem anterior. O jogo do Toshinden 3 é uma saída radical dos jogos anteriores da série. As arenas foram redesenhadas para que elas estejam agora fechadas, permitindo a possibilidade de mandar o oponente voando para uma parede ou o teto, embora o adversário possa se recuperar e usar a parede para um contra-ataque. O sistema combinado foi novamente redesenhado; Agora, cada personagem possui um intervalo predefinido de combo, no entanto, múltiplos combos e movimentos especiais agora podem ser combinados para fazer movimentos em série com o adversário, embora mais uma vez o oponente possa recuperar e contrariar seu combo. A física do jogo foi bastante relaxada para acomodar as novas arenas e jogos; Muitos ataques lançam o adversário em toda a arena. As versões U.S e E.U do Toshinden 3 apresentam um bloqueio ligeiramente diferente configurado em relação a versão japonesa. Na versão japonesa, existem blocos separados e baixos, enquanto que na versão U.S e E.U, o bloco alto foi alterado para ser um bloco de propósito geral e bloqueará tanto alta quanto baixa automaticamente. Esta pequena mudança tem um impacto notável nas peças do jogo. As versões U.S e E.U do Toshinden 3 também apresentam novas vozes em inglês para vários personagens e alguns novos modos de jogo; um modo de prática abrangente e um modo de Sobrevivência.</desc>

Select from a range of fighters (including Ryu, Ken, Guile, M. Bison and Chun Li) each with their own set of special moves, and defeat all of the opposition to become the King of Street Fighting. Also included is a story mode which follows the story of the movie and uses FMV in-between fights and a Trial Battle Mode, where you take on Guile in a range of different battle events to test your skills.</desc>

When the action stage begins, you'll start from a crouched position while enemy troops try and thwart your objective. While they're reloading, stand up and start spraying the area.

		<name>Battle Arena Toshinden 2</name>
		<desc>Himitsu Kessha founded the Toshinden--held annually, these tournaments feature strong combatants from all around the world. After the established corporation found out a nonsanctioned tournament was held by Gaia, they began organizing another Toshinden; their motivations are to lure the rebel to the tournament and have him slain for his insolence. Thus is the premise behind Battle Arena Toshinden 2, the sequel to the PlayStation's first rotational, 360-degree 3D fighting game. Featuring characters from the original, there are eleven fighters in all, including Eiji Shinjo, Kayin Amoh, Tracy, Chaos, and Duke B. Rambert; characters feature their own arenas, moves, combinations, weapons, and special attacks. Additionally, there is a mysterious bonus character waiting to be unlocked and two bosses to fight. There are a few game play options including the one player, full battle, and versus modes. Whereas the one player mode will have you battling against eight computer-controlled opponents, the full battle option throws you into a heated tournament of 10 characters--not including the bosses. The versus mode is selectable at any time, as long as you have access to a secondary controller; here you'll fight against a human opponent.</desc>

Twisted Metal possui muitas armas, incluindo mísseis de fogo, mísseis teleguiados, minas e, é claro, cada carro tem sua própria arma especial que causa danos enormes com efeitos interessantes. Todas as batalhas são travadas em arenas de combate 3D, com muitos power-ups e áreas secretas para encontrar, o que acrescenta profundidade - o que é importante porque Twisted Metal não é um jogo de um único jogador. Embora tenha um modo single player, a carne real está nas batalhas entre dois jogadores.</desc>

Since it was obviously something of value, it was decided that it would be awarded to the best fighter in the world. After all, who would appreciate a weapon more than an experienced fighter? Eleven of the world's finest combatants (including Cloud Strife, Tifa Lockhart and Vincent Valentine) have set out to claim this prize. The mysterious artifact came to be known as Ehrgeiz, and the tournament that was built around it took on the very same name. Now rumors suggest that the door to a long-forgotten land can be unlocked with this weapon; a land that could reveal the secret of immortality. The tournament has taken on a whole new meaning!</desc>

Her close friends begin to recollect her previous adventures, which occurred during different periods of her life. These include searching for the Philosopher's Stone in Rome; preventing the Spear of Destiny from falling into the hands of a ruthless gang leader; facing monsters on the Black Isle of Ireland as a child; and, finally, infiltrating a high-tech complex in pursuit of the Iris artefact. Like its predecessors, Tomb Raider: Chronicles is an action game with puzzle-solving and platforming elements. The gameplay is very similar to that of the previous games, with the addition of a few new skills. Lara can now walk on tightropes, swing on horizontal bars, and somersault forwards from a ledge while crouching. A grappling hook has been added to her inventory. The game also includes a level editor, allowing the player to create new stages for Lara to explore.</desc>

Some brave adventurers dared to enter the tower and to take the eggs. One of them was called Guy. He was killed in the monster tower. Now his son Koh is fifteen, and he is allowed to try his luck in the tower. You control Koh and his party of "familiars" in this unusual "monster-taming" RPG.

Different species have different abilities and need different approach. The battles system is a mixture of real time and turn based combat.

This game plays very much like any old platform game on the NES (specifically, it plays just like an old Castlevania), you walk slowly forward killing any demonic creature you meet. The game is mostly sideways, though you can jump or walk onto the platforms here and there. The game plays like an old game, but looks like a new one with completely remade 2D graphics, with FMV cutscenes, arranged high quality music and more.</desc>

		<name>Tenchu : Stealth Assassins</name>
		<desc>After firing your grappling hook to the rooftop of a small house, you pull yourself up and notice a guard pacing back and forth on the ground. He doesn't see you as you begin to crawl and sneak around on the roof. If he detects your presence, you will be in a world of hurt; you will blow your mission and risk death. Patiently, you wait for the right time to jump down -- and end his life while his back is turned. Set in 16th century Japan, Tenchu: Stealth Assassins is a simulation of the ways of the stealthy ninja. You'll chose between two characters, Rikimaru and Ayame, with a main objective of remaining unseen throughout ten non-linear missions. You will move through the shadows, make your way across rooftops, dash through trees -- anything to cloak yourself from enemy sight. While completing the missions, you are judged on three levels that measure your success in the fields of elusiveness and effectiveness. Each mission is different in its design and goal. Your mentor will have you run secret errands to informants, kill evil merchants and thieves, and rescue captive ninjas. Along the way, the enemy resistance has set up traps and assigned guards to keep a watchful eye for any interference (that would be you). Because Tenchu is a simulation of sorts, running up and engaging an enemy combat is not advised -- that's not the way of the ninja. A ninja is cunning and in order to uphold his duty, he must remain unseen. If you brazenly walk up to a group of enemies and try to kill them all, you may get through a couple, but you will ultimately fail and dishonor your people. As far as weaponry goes, make use of throwing stars and actual ninja assassin swords. For the truly cunning players, poisoned rice and smoke bombs are included as special items. If a guard will not go away, try putting some rice down for him to eat - he'll get sick and collapse.</desc>

		<name>Formula Karts : Special Edition</name>
		<desc>Following on from the hugely successful Super Karts and Manic Karts games, Formula Karts Special Edition sits you in a motorized sled which is capable of propelling you around 9 miniature race circuits at speeds over 70 mph. Now this may not sound particularly hair-raising but considering that your butt is only six inches from the track surface then only the brave and insane should apply. Championship is all about completing the race in the highest possible position. The further up field you finish, the more points awarded. This mode is more of a simulation where clipping too many corners and colliding with opponents vehicles will drastically affect the handling of your kart. Arcade has a few nice additional touches. You begin the season with three 'lives'. Complete each race inside the top three and you will progress onto the next race. Fail and a life is lost. In Arcade mode you initially begin each race with 3 Turbos and 3 Supergrips which can be activated at any point in the race.</desc>

		<desc>As a follow-up to the first LEGO Island PC title, LEGO Island 2: The Brickster's Revenge features Pepper Roni, a pizza delivery boy that players control, trying to save LEGO Island from the evil Brickster. The Brickster has dismantled the Infomaniac's building instruction book, known as the Constructopedia, and only Pepper can find the pages. Meanwhile, as if The Brickster and the havoc he wreaks aren't bad enough, Pepper has to keep his day job delivering pizzas. While exploring LEGO Island, clues and information must be obtained from the inhabitants. Playing as Pepper, gamers skateboard, walk, or otherwise transport themselves around the island, talking to people, solving puzzles, and playing a variety of sub-games. Bull fighting, jousting, driving, and flying are just some of the activities included in the sub-games. After winning enough mini-games and successfully navigating all areas, Pepper will be faced with the challenge to defeat The Brickster in one last game. If Pepper can avoid the falling bricks while clearing a path to The Brickster, he can throw pizzas that will splat the villain into submission. Other features and areas of the game include an inventory screen, Pepper's house (built with bricks he acquires during play), and additional pickup items for later use. Constructopedia pages must be collected in their entirety; gems and goblets increase scores, and medals can be earned based upon performances in sub-games.</desc>

		<path>./Tenchu - Stealth Assassins (USA) (v1.1).chd</path>
		<name>Tenchu : Stealth Assassins</name>
		<desc>After firing your grappling hook to the rooftop of a small house, you pull yourself up and notice a guard pacing back and forth on the ground. He doesn't see you as you begin to crawl and sneak around on the roof. If he detects your presence, you will be in a world of hurt; you will blow your mission and risk death. Patiently, you wait for the right time to jump down -- and end his life while his back is turned. Set in 16th century Japan, Tenchu: Stealth Assassins is a simulation of the ways of the stealthy ninja. You'll chose between two characters, Rikimaru and Ayame, with a main objective of remaining unseen throughout ten non-linear missions. You will move through the shadows, make your way across rooftops, dash through trees -- anything to cloak yourself from enemy sight. While completing the missions, you are judged on three levels that measure your success in the fields of elusiveness and effectiveness. Each mission is different in its design and goal. Your mentor will have you run secret errands to informants, kill evil merchants and thieves, and rescue captive ninjas. Along the way, the enemy resistance has set up traps and assigned guards to keep a watchful eye for any interference (that would be you). Because Tenchu is a simulation of sorts, running up and engaging an enemy combat is not advised -- that's not the way of the ninja. A ninja is cunning and in order to uphold his duty, he must remain unseen. If you brazenly walk up to a group of enemies and try to kill them all, you may get through a couple, but you will ultimately fail and dishonor your people. As far as weaponry goes, make use of throwing stars and actual ninja assassin swords. For the truly cunning players, poisoned rice and smoke bombs are included as special items. If a guard will not go away, try putting some rice down for him to eat - he'll get sick and collapse.</desc>

		<desc>"Is it just me, or am I engulfed in flames?" is one of the many one-liners uttered by Gex, a wise cracking gecko who should check himself into television rehab; he's addicted to it. After saving the Television Realm from the evil Rez in his first adventure, the gecko was ready to kick back, relax, and watch a little television. Little did he know his adventure was just beginning. One day, two secret agent goons showed up at Gex's doorstep. They inform him that Rez is back and looking for vengeance; the evil monster is planning to destroy the Television Realm once more...and possibly the world. When Gex tells them that he's retired and doesn't care, one of the goons hits the gecko on the head and takes him to a secluded place. When Gex comes to, the mystery men plead with the gecko to take the cash and help destroy Rez for good...or at least make him disappear. With that incentive (the cash), the wise cracking lizard slips into his special agent suit and plunges headfirst into the Television Realm. Watch out, Rez -- Gex is back!</desc>

		<name>Q*bert</name>
		<desc>Hasbro Interactive continues their series of classic Arcade game remakes with Q*bert for the PlayStation. In this disc you'll find the original game, a new Adventure mode and a special Head-To-Head contest. Those of you who misspent your youths in the Arcades will recall that the original Q*bert stars a little round orange guy with bulging eyes, a round snout for a nose, short legs and no arms or torso. Your job is to hop Q*bert around a pyramid of cubes and change the colors of the cubes to a target color. In later rounds, you will need to change the colors of the cubes more than once in order to achieve your goal. Once the entire pyramid has been changed to the target color, you advance to a new pyramid. While you are hopping Q*bert up and down the cubes of each pyramid, enemies, most of which are deadly to the touch, will try and stop your progress. Another way to die is to hop off of the pyramid without landing on one of the three discs that are placed above and beside the pyramid. These discs are useful when enemies, such as Coily the snake (Q*bert's archenemy), are in hot pursuit. Green enemies and objects can (and should be) be touched, and some of them cause trouble. For example, Slick and Sam wreak havoc by hopping on cubes and changing their color.</desc>

It debuted as a tokusatsu television series on April 3, 1971 and ran until February 10, 1973, airing on the Mainichi Broadcasting System and NET TV (now TV Asahi). A manga adaptation was also featured in Shonen Magazine around the same period. Although each entry in the series is different, each one shares similar traits with one and another. All generally involve at least one young adult male transforming into a Kamen Rider to fight various monsters and organizations linked to that specific Kamen Rider's origin. As the series progresses, the Rider often learns more about the monsters in the series, other Kamen Riders or the origin of his powers. Early Kamen Riders were generally based on grasshoppers, but this practice has only been done twice in the newer set of shows. Usually referred to as Rider Machines.</desc>

		<name>The Powerpuff Girls : Chemical X-Traction</name>
		<desc>The Powerpuff Girls is an American animated television series created by animator Craig McCracken and produced by Hanna-Barbera (later Cartoon Network Studios) for Cartoon Network. The show centers on Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup, three kindergarten-aged girls with superpowers, as well as their "father", the brainy scientist Professor Utonium, who all live in the fictional city of Townsville, USA. The girls are frequently called upon by the town's childlike mayor to help fight nearby criminals using their powers. The Powerpuff Girls revolves around the adventures of Blossom,bubbles, and buttercup . Each of the girls has a color; Bubbles is blue, Buttercup is green and Blossom is pink. The plot of a typical episode is some humorous variation of standard superhero and tokusatsu fare, with the girls using their powers to defend their town from villains and giant monsters. In addition, the girls also have to deal with normal issues young children face, such as sibling rivalries, loose teeth, personal hygiene, going to school, bed wetting, or dependence on a security blanket. Episodes often contain more or less hidden references to older pop culture. Powerpuff Girls: Chemical X-traction is a 3D fighting adventure featuring characters from Craig McCracken's hugely successful Cartoon Network series. Help Bubbles dispense a little justice on the wily Mojo Jojo or guide Buttercup to deliver a nice knuckle sandwich to deserving Gangreen Gang members. In the story mode, players can pick up objects and throw them at an enemy to decrease their opponents health meter. They can use superpowered attacks by collecting vials of Chemical X. If the player successfully defeats the enemy in two out of three rounds, they move to the next enemy location. Players can play the story mode or can battle against a friend in a head-to-head battle.</desc>

It seems that as an egg, Aladar was stolen and then accidentally dropped onto an island populated by lemurs. The colony took in the little dinosaur and raised him as their own. Players will get to take Aladar and his friends, Zini and Flia, on a journey across 12 different stages. Each of the friends possesses different abilities so players will have to exercise strategy and teamwork to navigate through each level. Want to smash a rock? You'll need Aladar's tail. If you need something airlifted, however, Flia is the only pteranodon in town. Players will have to avoid enemies and traps in this overhead 3D game while they gather items and accomplish level goals. Aladar wants to get back with his own species, but there are carnivores and other more pernicious things lying in wait.</desc>

		<path>./Destruction Derby RAW.PBP</path>
		<name>Destruction Derby Raw</name>
		<desc>Though not a product of Psygnosis, Destruction Derby Raw retains the same emphasis on wanton vehicular destruction as its forebears. "Wreckin' Racing," "Battle," "Smash 4 $," are the three main modes of play, each offering additional sub-modes. Wreckin' Racing provides some sense of more traditional racing, in that the goal is to finish each track in one of the top three positions in order to advance through a championship circuit, unlocking courses (31 in all) all the while. Knocking the opposition around is not entirely discouraged either. Battle enables four players to compete in split-screen competition across varying "disciplines." The Assault sub-mode is simply a last-man-standing event in which competitors battle head-to-head. Here, options such as the track and lap count can be adjusted as desired. The Destruction Derby event, a series staple, now offers Classic and Arena variations. In Skyscraper, players aim to push one another off the roof of a tall building. Last of all is Pass Da Bomb, where the object is, of course, to not have possession of the bomb. Smash 4 $ mode is fairly self-explanatory. To earn money (functionally equivalent to points), players are expected to liberally dole out damage to any of the other racers. High-speed collisions satisfy the basic requirement for "stunts." By pulling off a Corkscrew, Teeth Puller, or Bone Cruncher, players earn these much-needed points, and also cause real-time damage to the unlucky recipient's car. Point totals and finishing place all count towards a final point tally, which is in turn measured against a predetermined value. Players must earn enough to continue on to the next event. Accumulated cash can then be spent to upgrade or repair your vehicle.</desc>

There is a total of 12 characters, including the four story characters and the eight unlockable bosses. The game is controlled with two attack buttons (strong and weak) and the directional pad for moving left, right, crouching, and jumping. Shoulder buttons can also be used to change between foreground and background and can be used to activate the character's special attack. An unusual aspect of the game is that if the player stands still during an attack, it is considered a guard. Other features include a combo counter and a guided elemental attack which launches an enemy.</desc>

The player moves the protagonist, Klonoa, along a path in a two-dimensional fashion, but the game is rendered in three dimensions. This allows the path followed to curve and for the player to interact with objects outside of the path. The game is divided into levels called "Visions", where the player progresses by following a path with defeatable computer-controlled enemies and puzzles that must be solved. At the end of some levels, the player must defeat a boss - a powerful enemy.</desc>

		<desc>Take the law into your own hands. This game takes place in the Western United States during a time of world-wide oil shortage in 1976. OMAR (Oil Monopoly Alliance Regime) was making money off the shortage, except in the U.S. OMAR hires the best terrorist that $100 million could buy: Sid Burn. His job, aided by 5 hired Coyotes, is to destroy all gas refineries in the southwest of the U.S. so OMAR can bring the U.S. to its knees. Then later, when gas prices went wild, 6 civilians by the name of Vigilantes, lead by the truck driver Convoy, fight against the Coyotes in different areas to keep OMAR from succeeding. Choose from 8 characters with different endings with cars ranging to classic 70's muscle cars to a school bus, each stacked high with all sorts of weapons. Lots of unlockables include 2 hidden levels (3 hidden levels in the N64 version) and 5 hidden characters and cars. Multiplayer, of course, is where it's at. The PSX version allows 2 players, while the N64 title allows 4 to go head-to-head.</desc>

Few would dare to brave its unstable and searing environments - only those determined to grab a little of its remaining gold. You are one of those, taking your hover-bike into disintegrating caverns for a few hours of dangerous work which, successful or not, will be your last. Forsaken is a first-person shoot 'em up in which you have complete movement freedom in 3 dimensions, as you accelerate, swerve and strafe your craft, making for gameplay resembling Descent. Each level has a defined exit which must be reached within a tight time limit. The surrounding areas are collapsing around you, with spikes and turbine fans among your hazards. Be very aware of other craft out to take all you have, as they alter their approach based on your weaponry (from the 25 featured in the game) and past encounters. On the PC, multiplayer action can feature up to 12 human players. The Nintendo 64 version featured 4 player split-screen multiplayer, while the Playstation version has no multiplayer options.</desc>

		<desc>The fourth game in Activision and Neversoft's seminal skateboarding series is designed to bring additions and refinements to the already polished gameplay that's made Tony Hawk's Pro Skater one of the most important video game franchises of its time. Many of these improvements are in line with advances made in earlier THPS sequels, while others may come as a surprise to longtime fans of the series. Environments are designed to seem even larger and more interactive in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4, with less worry over time limits and more emphasis on exploration. The game also adds new tricks to the pro skaters' repertoires, allowing huge, point-packed combos. The "spine transfer" challenges skaters to zip up one side of a double ramp and down the other. Players will trick off of moving cars and other interactive elements of the game's diverse levels with new finesse.</desc>

His likeness, while not quite as familiar as Spider-Man's, has been featured on countless toys, action figures, games, and T-shirts. The Incredible Hulk - The Pantheon Saga is the big green guy's first appearance on the Sony PlayStation. In this 14 level punch-and-kickfest, he has been captured by members of the Pantheon. They intend to use his body for experimentation. As the transport ship reaches the Pantheon base, though, the ship crashes at the landing site, freeing Hulk to smash, destroy, and get revenge on his captors. Hulk can hit and kick opponents, windows, walls, and anything else that gets in his way. He is also capable of a variety of special moves including a booming Sonic Clap, a shattering Floor Smash, and a sweeping Vortex Spin.</desc>

However, humans quickly began to fear and distrust Repliforce's military power and their methods of fighting Mavericks proved to be very destructive with little disregard for human life. One day, the floating city Sky Lagoon was under attack by Mavericks and Repliforce arrived on the scene after the city has crash landed on the ground, where one of their leaders, Colonel, was being ordered by the Maverick Hunters X and Zero to lower his weapons for questioning as suspects for the incident. Out of pride and contempt towards human government, Colonel refused to comply, and following the accusations behind the Sky Lagoon incident, the Repliforce General decided stage a coup d'état, seeking to create a new utopia just for Reploids. Repliforce were then labeled as Mavericks by the government, thus the Maverick Hunters must fight against their former allies and stop their coup.</desc>

In all, twelve different vehicles are available to players in Ford Racing. The game features ten racetracks and a couple of different modes of play. Single-player and multiplayer races are available, as well as a career mode. Career mode allows players to race for sponsors, improving their vehicles with a share of the prize money.

		<path>./Double Dragon.PBP</path>
		<name>Double Dragon</name>
		<desc>Double Dragon 6-1 is a 1995 fighting game spinoff of the Double Dragon series developed and published by Technos Japan. It is based on the 1994 Double Dragon movie, which in turn was based on the original arcade game. It was originally released for the Neo Geo (in AES and MVS formats) and later released for the Neo Geo CD and PlayStation (the latter ported by Urban Plant). It was Technos Japan's last Double Dragon game before the company went out of business. The game plays like a conventional fighting game of its time, that is battles are one-on-one and conducted on best two-out-of-three matches. One of the unique aspects of Double Dragon is the lack of specific punch and kick buttons like most fighting games. Instead, there are four attack buttons of varying strength and speed, which can perform punches or kicks depending on the character's position. The player's character and his opponent have a super move meter called the "charge meter", which is overlaid on the character's remaining health. The less health the character has, the quicker it will fill up. "Charge moves" are usually performed by executing the command of a regular special move and pressing two attack buttons simultaneously at the end instead of just one.</desc>

		<path>./Tobal No.1 (USA).PBP</path>
		<name>Tobal No. 1</name>
		<desc>Tobal No. 1 is a fighting game for the PlayStation developed by DreamFactory and published by Square in 1996. The game was DreamFactory's first release, as well as Square's first release on the CD-based console. Tobal No. 1 marks Square's incursion into the fighting game genre, although an adventure-like quest mode is part of the game. The game's mechanics were designed with the aid of fighter game designer Seiichi Ishii, while all the characters were designed by Akira Toriyama of Dragon Ball fame. The sequel, Tobal 2, was never released in North America and Europe. Packaged with both the North American and Japanese version of the game was a sampler disc featuring a pre-release demo of Final Fantasy VII and video previews of Final Fantasy Tactics, Bushido Blade, and SaGa Frontier. STORY: Tobal No. 1 takes place in the year 2027 on a fictional planet called Tobal, which has large deposits of Molmoran, an ore that can be used as an energy source. The planet's 98th tournament is held to determine who has the rights to the ore. A number of humans and aliens compete for the title. The game's plot and character backstories are only explored in the instruction manual. All of the initial eight playable characters receive the same ending. The game's immediately playable characters include Chuji Wu, Oliems, Epon, Hom, Fei Pusu, Mary Ivonskaya, Ill Goga, and Gren Kutz. Bosses include Nork, Mufu, and the emperor Udan. All bosses are unlockable after defeating them in Dungeon Mode except Nork. Instead, the game allows the player to select Snork (Small Nork), a pint-sized version of the very large character. There is also one secret fighter named Toriyama Robo (named for Akira Toriyama) who is unlockable if the player can complete the 30-floor Udan's Dungeon level in the quest mode. Toriyama Robo is not seen at any point in the game except at the very end of the dungeon. GAMEPLAY: Tobal No. 1 has various gameplay modes including a tournament mode, two player versus mode, practice mode, and the unique quest mode, all of which utilize the same fighting system. The game itself runs at up to a smooth 60 frames per second due to its lack of textured polygons and reduced details which gave the game a distinctive look in comparison to other fighting games at the time, such as Tekken 2. The game's controls are unique in that they allow full freedom of movement in the ring as long as the player faces the opponent. The player has the ability to dash and jump, and certain buttons execute high, medium, and low attacks for each character. Tobal No. 1 also has an intuitive grappling and blocking system, offering the player a variety of throws and counter moves. Perhaps the most distinctive feature of Tobal No. 1 is the "Quest Mode", which combines the game's fighting controls with three-dimensional dungeon exploration. The player must advance down a number of floors, contend with traps, and engage in fights with a variety of enemies including the game's playable characters. Several items can be found, dropped by enemies, or bought using crystals. These items can be picked up, consumed, or thrown at enemies, and include foodstuffs that can restore the player's HP or potions that have a range of effects including raising the player's maximum health or bringing it down to 1 point. There is no way to save one's progress, and dying means starting over from the beginning. Defeating certain characters in this mode unlocks them as playable characters in the game's other modes. Each of the eight initially playable characters can perform high, medium, and low attacks, and the game makes use of a grappling and blocking system that lets players execute a variety of throws and counterattacks. Features: Featuring such modes of play as "Tournament," "Vs.," and "Quest" Kick, punch, guard, jump, dash, and attack your way through the darkness of a dungeon to locate the Molmoran Select from 11 different characters including Emperor Udan, Nork, Hom, Epon, and Oliems</desc>

Unlike many ninjas before him, he is able to summon powers of the arcane; magical spells that do great damage to those cast upon. And he'll need it - the world has been cast into utter darkness in which monsters and creatures from the beyond roam. There are four different worlds broken into 11 distinctive levels - Kurosawa will travel throughout cemeteries, rocky mountain terrain, coastal areas, deep and dark forests, etc. The goal in each is to survive, which is often easier said than done. As alluded to earlier, monsters (such as goblins) are out for your blood - even fellow ninjas who've turned to the dark side will meet you with resistance.</desc>

The PS1 and Saturn versions are known as Pu-Li-Ru-La Arcade Gears. The PS2 version is part of a compilation called Taito Memories (Volume 1), but omitted from the international release of Taito Legends. PuLiRuLa is known for its distinct graphics and odd story line. PuLiRuLa takes place in Radishland, a land where time is kept correctly flowing with a time key. However, "a bad man appeared and stole the time key to stop the time flow. The towns were attacked one by one, the time flow was stopped and they received damage", as the English translation explains. Zac and Mel, the playable characters, are requested by an old man to defend their town. The old man also gives the children a "magic stick" to fight with.</desc>

A série é ambientada em um universo de terror gótico e apresenta um estilo gráfico de desenho animado altamente estilizado. O Jogo apresenta personagens baseados em vários tipos de monstros (os "darkstalkers" titulares) ou em seus caçadores, todos envolvidos em combate uns contra os outros. Darkstalkers introduziu muitos dos conceitos usados em jogos de luta posteriores da Capcom, incluindo o seu primeiro uso de sprites de animação colorida de 16 bits e mecânica de jogo mais tarde empregada nas séries Street Fighter Alpha e Marvel vs. Capcom.</desc>

		<desc>This is a 2D fighting game. You get to choose from 10 different characters in Guilty Gear, each with his or her own set of moves and special attacks. Moves are carried out in typical fighting game style (button combinations) and the game handles very well. All the characters are pretty much balanced and fair except some moves are a bit too excessive. A few characters can execute attacks that really take off way too much damage and this is real the problem with the game.</desc>

In the previous Digimon World, you played as a young boy who was called to the Digital World in order to save the digimon from a terrible fate and had a partner digimon which needed your care. In this second game, your role is that of a new Guard Tamer who's destined to protect the Digital city, and the Digital world. Now you can fight in all new 3-on-3 battles. There is now a way for you to raise your digimon party to higher levels, and digivolve them to the new 'mega' level, unseen in the previous game (where 'ultimate' level was the limit). The new DNA-Digivolving gives you even further ways to gain new and more powerful digimon.</desc>

		<desc>Why do people hate? What causes such intense animosity that a person would go to any length to hurt someone, perhaps even destroy them? These are just a few questions posed by the relationship of Jax and Kano. Is it because Jax is a Special Forces agent and must bring Kano to justice? Could it be that simple? Would it justify following him to another realm and becoming involved in the Mortal Kombat competition? Can hate make you so blind that you'd face demons in hopes of facing the one man you truly want to destroy? Greater yet is the mystery of how Kano became involved with Shang Tsung and the significance of the Black Dragon. So many questions left unanswered, so many things seemingly left to chance. At least until now... In Mortal Kombat Special Forces by Midway, you play as Jax. Your mission is to destroy Kano and his army of thugs, but it won't be easy. You have to explore 3D environments from a third-person perspective and find hidden areas. Punch, kick, and shoot your way through the droves of enemies you'll face. Watch out for thugs armed with guns and other weapons trying to snuff out your life before you can get to your true objective. Be sure to pay close attention to incoming messages. They will give hints and help you solve the riddle of hate. They may even lead you to some secret places too. Collect items and weapons in order to increase your firepower and fill your health meter -- there is even a sniper rifle for some long distance attacks. Amass experience points and learn new and devastating combo moves. Pull off one of those combos at the right time, and witness a gruesome fatality. Can you overcome your hatred? Or will you be another fatality?</desc>

		<desc>Adam Crowley, a once-respected scientist, now turned to black magic, has released a demonic contagion onto the streets of 1834 London. Based on the long-lost work of the Brotherhood of Hecate, it mutates its victim's bodies into grotesque nightmare creatures, and changes their minds into those of murderous brutes. When Dr. Jean F. began investigating, he was murdered. Now, as either his friend Ignatius Blackward, a priest and expert on the occult, or his daughter Nadia, a biologist and gymnast, fight against the creatures that roam the streets of London, the revived Brotherhood of Hectate, and the man behind it all, Adam Crowley. Gameplay is 3rd-person action, with an emphasis on melee combat. Ignatius and Nadia have different fighting styles and special moves. To keep things moving, an adrenaline meter depletes, killing the hero if it ever runs out. Kill monsters to top it up again. Gather special items to use on enemies, or just kill them using basic weapons.</desc>

Power-ups give Digimon characters defining special abilities that can make a difference in close contests and platform traps like conveyor belts and falling icicles are part of the mix. In single-player mode, you compete against the computer by clearing stages and advancing through all 20 characters. Six environments include Sanctuary (lightening bolts), Wilderness (boulders), Garbage Recycling Center (compactor), Revolution (rotating screen), Glacier (icicles), and Volcano, with a few mini-games thrown in for fun. Two-player action lets you compete against another human, while the Versus Computer mode offers single matches against the computer where you pick the level and character to fight. Each Digimon has special moves, such as Wormon's sticky net, Stingmon's moon shooter, and MegaGargomon's bum rush, and gaining enough energy allows them to "digivolve" into more powerful versions for a limited amount of time. Special items featuring positive and negative effects appear sporadically during the fighting and affect gameplay: digi plus, digi minus, max and forced digivolve, power down, queen device, evil ring and spiral bomb, and fire, water, and wind attacks. Features: Campaign, two-player, and single-match fighting modes Twenty characters from all three seasons of Digimon: Digital Monsters Six arenas, power ups, and special moves Mini-games during Single Player combat</desc>

		<name>Grand Theft Auto</name>
		<desc>In Grand Theft Auto, you assume the role of a street thug working for an organized syndicate of criminals that specializes in stealing cars. Every time your pager beeps, the boss needs you to steal something for him -- if you don't get to a payphone and answer the message, you'll be in hot water (or is that cold water at the bottom of the East River). After receiving your mission, you'll have to navigate city streets that are bustling with pedestrians, cops (your worst enemies), and traffic jams. Because you're pressed for time, you can't just walk to your destination on foot -- that would take too long. Instead, you'll have to go car jacking, the art of physically removing people out of their vehicles and stealing it. This is the premise behind Grand Theft Auto, an overhead action game of thievery. There are four large cities in which you'll have to steal cars, shoot rival gang members, and complete missions for the boss. Each mission requires you to get something from point "A" to point "B". For example, the head honcho wants to pull off a bank heist -- instead of using regular cars, they want you to steal a couple taxicabs for them. This way, the cops won't be able to find them as easily in traffic.</desc>

		<desc>In the value-priced Crossroad Crisis, it's up to you to protect a wandering baby chick stranded in a maze of red, green and blue tiles. By moving and rotating the tiles, you can create a safe path for the chick to walk on. But in order to complete each of the game's ten stages, you must first clear the required number of tiles from the board. Tiles are cleared by linking two or more of the same color and having the chick walk over them. Once the target number has been cleared, the exit appears and you can lead the chick to the next stage. The number of cleared tiles necessary to reveal the exit increases as the game progresses. Each time the chick walks off the edge of a tile, a life is lost and the board is reset. In addition to the ten stages of Clear mode, Vs. mode pits the chick against a duck in a two-player battle to clear tiles and lead your animal to safety first. Beginner mode contains three stages and a lesson on how to play.</desc>

There is also an improved multiplayer element and tons of new weapons, including an X-Ray sniper rifle and an explosive shotgun.</desc>

One night, Oshima Goketsuji unexpectedly appeared in front of Oume and offered her help to take revenge of Otane. According to the rules of the clan, if the leader dies or quits, one new tournament should be held immediately to find a successor. That same night Oshima and Oume sent their servants to dispose of Otane, so while Otane slept, she was kidnapped and thrown to the ocean. Next day Kuroko found a letter supposedly written by Otane, where she declined to her right to be the leader of the clan. One week later all the competitors from the previous tournament and other family members were convoked to be informed about Otane's decision and the beginning of a new tournament.</desc>

		<path>./Ultraman Tiga &amp; Dyna Fighting Evolution - New Generations (Japan).chd</path>
		<name>Ultraman Tiga And Ultraman Dyna - Aratanaru Futatsu No Hikari</name>
		<desc>Ultraman is a fictional character featured in tokusatsu, or "special effects" television programs in Japan. Ultraman made his debut in the tokusatsu SF/kaiju/superhero TV series, Ultra Q: Ultraman: Special Effects Fantasy Series, a follow-up to the television series Ultra Q. The show was produced by Tokyo Broadcasting System and Tsuburaya Productions, and was broadcast on Tokyo Broadcasting System (TBS) from July 17, 1966 to April 9, 1967, with a total of 39 episodes (40, counting the pre-premiere special that aired on July 10, 1966). Ultraman Tiga is a Japanese tokusatsu TV show and is the 11th show in the Ultra Series. Produced by Tsuburaya Productions, Ultraman Tiga was aired at 6:00pm and aired between September 7, 1996 to August 30, 1997, with a total of 52 episodes with 4 movies (3 being crossovers, 1 a direct sequel to the series) After a franchise hiatus of over 15 years, set in a universe different from all previous series and updated with a new look and feel. Tiga is the first Ultraman with multiple combat modes and non-red colors. It was one of the popular entries in the Ultra Series. Because of Tiga's popularity, he had more exposure on TV and movies than any other Heisei Ultraman. Ultraman Tiga was also dubbed in English by 4Kids Entertainment and broadcast in the United States as part of the Fox Box programming block on Fox Broadcasting Company affiliates, the third Ultra Series to air in the United States. Plot: Set in the years 2007-2010 (2049 in the U.S. dub) , giant monsters and conquering aliens start to appear, as was foretold by an apocalyptic prophecy about an uncontrollable chaos over the Earth. Facing the threat, the TPC (Terrestrial Peaceable Consortium) is created, such as its branch, GUTS (Global Unlimited Task Squad). Through a holographic message in a capsule found by researchers, the GUTS gets knowledge about a golden pyramid built by an ancient civilization. At the site, three statues of a race of giants who defended early human civilization on Earth about 30,000,000 years ago from Super-Ancient Monsters and other forces of darkness are found, but two of them are destroyed by the monsters Golza and Melba. The third one gains life from the spiritual energy of officer Daigo, descendant of the ancient race. Daigo and the remaining statue merge into a single being, made of light. Shortly after defeating the two monsters, Daigo is revealed by the hologram of the prophecy that 30 million years in the past, a great evil that not even the giants could stop, destroyed the ancient civilization. The same evil reappears in the finale of the series, the Ruler of Darkness Ghatanothoa, and his servants, Gijera and Zoigar. Ghatanothoa defeats Ultraman with ease and turns him back into a statue, but the light of humanity is able to turn him into Glitter Tiga, giving him the power to defeat Ghatanothoa and save the Earth. Ultraman Dyna is a Japanese tokusatsu TV show which aired between September 6, 1997 to August 29, 1998. The series is a direct sequel to the previous Ultraman series, Ultraman Tiga. Plot: In the year AD 2017 (nine years after the final episode of Ultraman Tiga), TPC has advanced beyond earth, and has created a new GUTS team, "Super GUTS". Humans have begun terra-forming Mars and other planets in what is known as the "Age of the Neo Frontier". One day, however, the Neo Frontier is attacked by an alien race known as the Spheres. Shin Asuka has just joined Super GUTS and is in the middle of training maneuvers above Earth's atmosphere when he and his comrades are attacked. He proves himself in battle, and can hold his own against ace pilot Ryoh. However, his ship is damaged and he ejects, after which he encounters a shining light. It is then that a new giant of light merges with the bewildered Asuka, saving his life. When the Spheres enter Mars' atmosphere and merge with the Martian rocks to form monsters, Asuka again participates in the battle, now equipped with a mysterious device known as the "Reflasher". Upon the Sphere's new attack, Asuka suddenly transforms into a colossal giant, and manages to protect Mars from a group of monsters sent by the Spheres. The members of Super GUTS quickly catch on that this giant being is not Ultraman Tiga, but a new giant of light, "Ultraman Dyna". In contrast to the serious tone of Ultraman Tiga, Ultraman Dyna is a far more light hearted show, featuring more upbeat stories and goofy character personalities for its cast. The final story arc is rather somber, in contrast to the rest of the series. Dyna/Asuka apparently sacrifice themselves to save the Earth from Gran Sphere, the planet-sized mother form of the Spheres. Though the fate of Dyna and Asuka is not at all clear from the final episode, we do get to see that Asuka rejoins his father as they ride off toward the light in their two spaceships. It is revealed in Mega Monster Battle: Ultra Galaxy Legend The Movie, however, that the wormhole resulting from Gran Sphere's destruction transported him to the M78 universe, where the film takes place. Ultraman Tiga &amp; Ultraman Dyna Fighting Evolution - New Generations is a 3d fighting game with 14 different stages in the story mode where Tiga &amp; Dyna have to protect Earth against evil enemies and an unlockable monster guide with character profiles that will be unlocked playing the main game.</desc>

		<name>Voltage Fighter - Choujin Gakuen Gowcaizer</name>
		<desc>Choujin Gakuen Gowcaizer, also known as Voltage Fighter Gowcaizer is a 1995 superhero-themed head-to-head fighting game produced by Technos Japan Corp. for the Neo Geo arcade and home console. It was the company's third attempt at a fighting game after the success of Capcom's 1991 arcade-hit Street Fighter II, following the 1992 Family Computer title Nekketsu Kakuto Densetsu, and the Neo Geo fighting game version of Double Dragon. It features character designs by artist Masami Obari, who previously worked on the anime adaptations of the Fatal Fury series. Ports of the game were released for the Neo-Geo CD and PlayStation (Japan only). In 1995 it appeared on the Neo Geo then in 1997 it was ported over to the PSX by Urban Plant. Its a VERY RARE game to get hold of now since there never was a reprint of it. Exclusive PSX features: - A new full motion anime intro. - A new 3d mode. It seems like 70% of the sprite animations are missing compared to the arcade version. The PSX exclusive 3D mode is pointless and at best a novelty. The backgrounds and characters are still 2D but the camera moves around. The background is basically a wallpaper on a black background and everything looks very tacky indeed.

		<name>Point Blank 3</name>
		<desc>The escapades of Namco's Dr. Dan and Dr. Don continue in Point Blank 3, the third edition of the irreverent, mini-game based light-gun series. A selection of 80 events are offered, many of which thrust the hapless duo into situations that require timely intervention by the player on their behalf, testing your reflexes and shooting accuracy at the same time. The myriad of events present the player with basic tasks that range in both scope and difficulty. A plethora of mini-game formats are provided that include shooting color-coded targets to protecting the two numbskulls from threatening objects, to those that require the player to perform rudimentary mathematics calculations before shooting the correct answer. Cameo appearances by Tekken characters, classic Namco franchises and other such in-jokes abound in the many scenarios players will find themselves embroiled. Arcade, Training and Endurance modes cater mostly to single play, while the Versus and Party modes support multi-player competition, the latter for up to eight players in a tournament-style elimination event. Arcade mode grants one or two players the opportunity to advance through 16 randomly selected stages on the difficulty level of their choosing, while Training lets players practice any of the available levels. Endurance sees players attempt to pass as many stages as possible with the scant three lives supplied. After every ten stages a bonus event is provided that gives the player an opportunity to earn extra lives or points. The game supports play with both the standard controller and Namco's GunCon peripheral.</desc>

		<name>Tiny Toon Adventures : Plucky's Big Adventure</name>
		<desc>Players head out for an adventure with the Tiny Toons gang in Tiny Toon Adventures: Plucky's Big Adventure for PlayStation. In this title, based on the Tiny Toons animated series kids can play as Plucky, Hamton, Buster and Babs as they explore twenty-plus levels of Acme Looniversity in search of parts for a time machine for Plucky. While avoiding the incorrigible Elmyra and Montana Max, players help the gang seek out the time machine parts in order for Plucky to travel back in time to finish his homework. Searching all over the Looniversity in Acme Acres, players explore many places including the music room, history room, tennis courts and hallways. Items will vary from a bicycle pump to a potato and once an item is found, players can proceed with the level or return to the controlling character's respective locker to store the item. Each character can carry only three items at one time and players must decide which items are the most useful for each current level. Certain items are not time machine parts but rather will be used to acquire parts later in the game. Elmyra and Montana Max, the game's only obstacles, must be avoided in order to complete the game. They can each capture the character they confront and will lock them away until another character rescues them. If they capture all four characters, the game is the over. Providing players can successfully avoid the antagonistic characters, and locate all the missing time machine parts, the game is won. The game also features a handful of other Tiny Toon characters such as Dizzy and GOGO with which the main characters interact.</desc>

It debuted as a tokusatsu television series on April 3, 1971 and ran until February 10, 1973, airing on the Mainichi Broadcasting System and NET TV (now TV Asahi). A manga adaptation was also featured in Shonen Magazine around the same period. Although each entry in the series is different, each one shares similar traits with one and another. All generally involve at least one young adult male transforming into a Kamen Rider to fight various monsters and organizations linked to that specific Kamen Rider's origin. As the series progresses, the Rider often learns more about the monsters in the series, other Kamen Riders or the origin of his powers. Early Kamen Riders were generally based on grasshoppers, but this practice has only been done twice in the newer set of shows. Usually referred to as Rider Machines.</desc>

The object of the game is to throw a plasma ball into a round goal that is suspended above the middle of a hockey-sized arena. Before you or your computer opponent can make a basket, the ball must be charged. Each team's charger is located in their opponents end of the court. Be careful, though: If the ball is charged with your opponent's color and you make a basket, your opponent gets the points. The same rule applies for the opposing team. There are different zones on the court and depending on where a player is standing when he makes a shot, he will score one, two, or three points. There are sixteen different teams to choose from, representing the countries of England, France, the United States, Germany, Japan, Mexico, Australia, and Russia. Each team has four players on the court at once. Most of the action consists of passing, shooting, and stealing the ball, punching and sliding into your opponents, and a whole lot of running. Features: * Lead one of 16 international teams to victory in a futuristic sport resembling basketball * Watch the action from a choice of camera angles, including multiple overhead views * Compete in league, tournament, and exhibition play</desc>

What is new is that the graphical "breakability" of the robots' bodies has changed. The characters' shells actually burst apart instead of just revealing the burning, flickering wires inside - as before, this damage makes them more vulnerable to damage if hit again in the same area. One advance that Zero Divide boasts over its predecessor is the ability to save up to 200 match replays on the PlayStation memory card. STORY: In the year 20xx, each nation of the world's information facility was shaken up by the enigma hacker group's alias, [XTAL TOWER] incident. The end result was to destroy the the suspected life program, which had the power to control libraries. As a result, the chaos of information was suppressed to a minimum. From the data gained at the time of destruction of [XTAL], information on the hackers, the ones that are thought to have performed the crime, has been recovered. Using this information, each nation's information facility have conducted an investigation of world-wide scope. They spent a year in chasing the hackers that were running from place to place. In the end, they finally gained specifics on the criminals, and arrested four hackers from various parts of the world. It looked as if this was the end of everything. However, the principal offender known as [EXE] as he calls himself, started to tell a dreadful truth during the examination. Their true purpose was not network terrorism, rather through the medium obtained by [XTAL TOWER] , to release the program called [EVE]. On the network, there exists an enormous wealth of knowledge and information. This [EVE] uses that information for "itself", and has the will to think for "itself", making it the ultimate Life Reality Program. To stop the existence of this [EVE], the only way is for them to access the [Aggresive Nature Program]. These programs still are self-evolving somewhere over the network, even after the destruction of [XTAL].</desc>

		<name>Roswell Conspiracies : Aliens, Myths &amp; Legends</name>
		<desc>Roswell Conspiracies: Aliens, Myths and Legends was an animated program, that originally aired in 1999 as part of BKN, the syndicated's cartoon programing block. The programming segment premiered in 1992. The show was part of BKN's drive to reinvent itself. The show's premise was that aliens had been living among humans for ages, and were the origins of many of the creatures humans know from myth, folklore and legends, including vampires and werewolves. On the show, the Roswell UFO Incident which is part of a conspiracy theory (that many real life people still hold to this day) is portrayed as being a man made phenomenon. It was set up by humans to deflect popular attention from the truth. The unidentified flying object was a prop; the body of a little green or grey man was a dummy; the witnesses to the crash were plants; as were the Air Force investigators. In fact the whole shadow world surrounding Area 51 was nothing but a distraction from the fact that the aliens had landed long ago and there were known incidents of their desire to attack, assimilate and/or destroy the human race.</desc>

		<name>Pandemonium 2</name>
		<desc>In this sequel to Pandemonium, the player once again controls the young aspiring sorceress Nikki and the court jester Fargus with his puppet buddy Sid. It is the year of Cheese, and the advent of the Comet of Infinite Possibilities is foretold by the great prophet Nosewasinit. Naturally, Nikki and Fargus are interested in this comet; but they are not the only ones. The evil Goon Queen Zorrscha wants to use the comet for her own plans, so our heroes have to reach it first... The gameplay is similar to that of the first game; despite the 3D graphics, the gameplay mechanics are those of 2D platformers. The player can select Nikki or Fargus for each level. Each of the two has different abilities. For example, Nikki can jump higher, while Fargus can use his puppet Sid for a variety of attacks. The characters can also acquire power-ups, such as fire and lightning ranged attacks for Nikki or various Sid enhancements for Fargus. There are also level-specific items and vehicles the heroes will encounter on their way.</desc>

Some old obstacles and enemies appear, such as tar pits that can open up beneath Harry and swallow him whole, ever-present scorpions, and old favorites like rolling logs and handy vines, which can be found smattered around the jungle. But there are new dangers as well, including the sinister flying darters, and new wonders to behold, such as gravity-defying lucense. Harry Jr. gets by much the same way his father did -- he can dodge out of the way, jump over obstacles, and take a swing at attackers with his trusty pick-axe. The object is to guide Harry Jr. through 11 levels, trying to discover what happened to the Moku civilization, and finally into a confrontation with the mighty Scourge, who's holding this alternate dimension hostage. Oh, and Harry might want to grab some treasure along the way too -- just like dear old Dad. Features * Explore the landscapes of an active volcano, a prison colony, and Scourge's lair * Swing, jump, and hurdle to avoid enemies and obstacles in each environment * Lead Harry through a variety of levels in a different world to save Earth from an evil temptress</desc>

		<name>Space Invaders</name>
		<desc>In 1978, Earth successfully repulsed an invasion from outer space thanks to "the Tank." The Tank was based on alien technology found when a scout ship had crashed years earlier. Now, over 20 years later, a new Tank has been created based on the technology recovered during the 1978 invasion. And none too soon, because the Invaders are back! Space Invaders is yet another classic arcade game remake by Activision. (See Battlezone and Asteroids.) But this time, Activision licensed a game from Taito instead of Atari. The game stays close to its roots while adding many power-ups and enemies. You can play either one or two players against the Invaders, who march down the screen in orderly rows and columns, at one of three skill levels. You'll start at Pluto and work your way through the Solar System to Mars, then Venus, and finally Earth. There are four common aliens (red, green, blue, and yellow), plus seven more less common ones. You receive special one shot power-ups by shooting four of the same type of Invaders in a row. As in the original game, there are also Mother Ships that fly above the action, but in this version if you hit them you can pick up other useful power-ups like shields or double shots. Plus, after fighting off several waves on each planet, you'll face a unique boss. If you manage to finish the game, you'll be able to play a reproduction of the original coin-op.</desc>

Inspired by Contra and other such titles, One is a pseudo-3D scrolling shooter in which players find themselves traversing a variety of locales, from futuristic Blade Runner-esque cities to remote mountainous regions, all in search of answers. The central gameplay mechanic is the player's Rage meter. Simply put, John Cain is fueled by rage. By destroying objects, killing people, and generally causing all kinds of wanton mayhem, he will increase in power. Cain's rage is represented by an orb-like indicator that undergoes a number of color changes, from the relative calm of green to an infuriated red, and beyond.</desc>

The tracks are based on locations from all six movies, so gamers can expect to find familiar areas; ranging from the skyline of Manhattan, to the cold reaches of Outer Space. Each Muppet movie, 'The Muppet Movie', 'The Great Muppet Caper', 'Muppets Take Manhattan', 'The Muppet Christmas Carol', 'Muppet Treasure Island', and 'Muppets From Space', has 4 related tracks. Therefore, 24 courses in total. At the outset there are 8 Muppet drivers available: Kermit, Miss Piggy, Fozzie, Rizzo, Gonzo, Beaker, Rowlf, and Animal. As a reward for winning races more characters are unlocked - with 17 other Muppet stars made available. Also included, are FMV scenes taken from each movie.</desc>

		<desc>E.T. may have left Earth safely onboard his spaceship, but trouble awaits him soon after landing in this 3D PlayStation adventure. The universe is in danger and only E.T. can help save it, by finding exotic plants. As the kind-hearted alien from the 1982 film, re-released in 2002 to commemorate its 20th anniversary, players must rescue rare plants from a total of five planets: Green Planet, Ice Planet, Desert Planet, Planet Metropolis, and Earth. Each planet contains a specific number of plants to find across three levels. Worlds are also filled with hostile creatures or government agents, so E.T. needs to use his special powers to help him overcome all manner of threats. As E.T. walks and runs across the levels, he can call upon the power of telekinesis to move items closer, use his healing power to restore flowers, and unleash a heart stun to temporarily freeze enemies. Also available on each level are items such as keys or switches, which let E.T. access blocked areas. Progress in the adventure can be saved to a memory card.</desc>

Some of these new features including a "Freestyle" control, which is activated by the right thumbstick, causing you to do special moves, such as a deke, or kick the ball a fair length forwards to gain some speed. New and improved "dead ball" control makes corner kicks, free kicks, etc. more controllable and gives you more options. The passing game has been improved as to allow better passing by kicking directly to a teammate, passing to nowhere in particular, or open passing to allow anybody to take it. FIFA 2003 includes all FIFA clubs, leagues, and players.</desc>

		<desc>Conrad may have thought he escaped from the alien Morphs, but he thought wrong. After fighting his way through their world the first time, in a game called Flashback, he went into a cryogenic sleep aboard his little space vessel. For 50 years he drifted aimlessly in space, waiting to be found. The good news is that Conrad was found and beamed up on an alien ship; the bad news is that the alien race that found him is none other than his enemy: the Morphs. Once again, he must escape from their hostile world and regain his freedom that he had fought so hard for. Fade To Black is a sequel to the 2D classic Flashback. It picks up 50 years after the latter did, and uses the same character. Where this sequel differs is that it features 3D graphics in a 3D world, allowing players to immerse themselves even more in Conrad's struggle for freedom. The game features over 13 levels filled with intricate puzzles, sub-levels and missions, highly detailed textures and graphics, lots of items to interact with and a good amount of action. Features: # 13 levels # A variety of sublevels and challenging puzzles # Detailed 3D rendered characters # Simplified controls and gameplay</desc>

		<path>./Legacy of Kain Soul Reaver.chd</path>
		<name>Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver</name>
		<desc>1500 years after Blood Omen: Legacy of Kain, the vampire Kain's decision at the end of that game has finally defeated the human kingdoms and brought the world of Nosgoth under his control. Ruling from a castle built on the Pillars of Nosgoth, Kain has established an empire of six vampire clans, each ruled by a lieutenant, the sons of Kain. Raziel was one such lieutenant, but lost his position through the "insolence" of receiving a new evolutionary "dark gift", the growth of feathery wings, before his master had acquired it. Fearing that Raziel might one day surpass him, Kain tears off Raziel's wings in a fit of range and banishes him into the Abyss. There, Raziel is lost in time, died and his body consumed. The Elder God recovers Raziel's soul and rebuilds the broken body, not as a living vampire, but as a strange new creature of the underworld. Swearing revenge on Kain, Raziel now phases seamlessly between Nosgoth and it's underworld, using his new powers to become a terrible reaver of souls... Soul Reaver is a 3rd person action-adventure title that follows Raziel on his quest to purge the land of vampires and take revenge on Kain and his brothers, leaders of the six clans. The player controls the game from behind Raziel's shoulder, moving him in any direction, climbing, attacking, jumping and using specific abilities. Raziel's can grip onto the edge of ledges and his torn wings allow him to glide gently downwards. Raziel can shift through the "material" world into the "spectral" realm at will... but must find specific locations in order to shift back. The two realms mirror one another, with distortions which give access to new areas and platforms. Existing in the material world drains Raziel's life energy at a constant rate. Throughout the game, energy is recovered by consuming the souls of defeated enemies. If Raziel is able to defeat one of his brothers, he will additionally gain a new ability ("dark gift") upon drinking it's soul. Examples include: the ability to swim, file telekinetic projectiles or the ability to phase through locked gates. Raziel can arm himself with a variety of weapons including spears, daggers, swords, axes, as well as attacking enemies barehanded. Eventually, Raziel will also come across Kain's personal sword (named the Soul Reaver), and will use it to create a powerful energy blade weapon. The world is left open to Raziel, he can return to areas previously completed and explore the world of Nosgoth at will. Access to certain areas however sometimes requires the use of gained specific abilities. Many of the puzzles the player will need to solve in this quest are "block puzzles", requiring the placement of certain large structures (usually square blocks), either to activate switches or to build access to out-of-reach areas.</desc>

How was Phix to know the importance of that magic stone that fell from the sky? Still, he probably shouldn't have eaten it -- now the world of Magnetica is in turmoil and only Phix can set things right.

Phix will also face fierce creatures and collect special crystals as he makes his way to the Sanctuary, to return the magic stone to its proper place and Magnetica to its former, peaceful state.

		<desc>In Xevious 3-D/G+, you pilot a sleek Solvalou space fighter blasting and bombing your way through an overwhelming alien invasion force consisting of airborne attackers, ground defenses, and enormous "boss" motherships. Based on the premise that aliens who originally settled Earth have returned (and they're not happy about the proliferation of the human race, go figure), Xevious 3-D/G+ is a 3-D remake of the original Namco classic Xevious (licensed to Atari in the early 1980s). The new game sticks to the basic concepts of the original Xevious, right down to the familiar overhead view. Power-ups offer new weapons such as constant-fire, electrocution beams and wide-dispersal lasers --- but along with new weapons come new enemies and new bosses who aren't quite so easy to eliminate. Included as a bonus are the original Xevious, emulated to perfection (a nice addition since the only other PlayStation version available is on the rather hard-to-find Namco Museum Volume 2), and the only console version available of Xevious Arrangement, a more obscure coin-up conversion designed to vex those who had plowed their way through the original.</desc>

		<path>./Tobal No.1 (USA).chd</path>
		<name>Tobal No. 1</name>
		<desc>Tobal No. 1 is a fighting game for the PlayStation developed by DreamFactory and published by Square in 1996. The game was DreamFactory's first release, as well as Square's first release on the CD-based console. Tobal No. 1 marks Square's incursion into the fighting game genre, although an adventure-like quest mode is part of the game. The game's mechanics were designed with the aid of fighter game designer Seiichi Ishii, while all the characters were designed by Akira Toriyama of Dragon Ball fame. The sequel, Tobal 2, was never released in North America and Europe. Packaged with both the North American and Japanese version of the game was a sampler disc featuring a pre-release demo of Final Fantasy VII and video previews of Final Fantasy Tactics, Bushido Blade, and SaGa Frontier. STORY: Tobal No. 1 takes place in the year 2027 on a fictional planet called Tobal, which has large deposits of Molmoran, an ore that can be used as an energy source. The planet's 98th tournament is held to determine who has the rights to the ore. A number of humans and aliens compete for the title. The game's plot and character backstories are only explored in the instruction manual. All of the initial eight playable characters receive the same ending. The game's immediately playable characters include Chuji Wu, Oliems, Epon, Hom, Fei Pusu, Mary Ivonskaya, Ill Goga, and Gren Kutz. Bosses include Nork, Mufu, and the emperor Udan. All bosses are unlockable after defeating them in Dungeon Mode except Nork. Instead, the game allows the player to select Snork (Small Nork), a pint-sized version of the very large character. There is also one secret fighter named Toriyama Robo (named for Akira Toriyama) who is unlockable if the player can complete the 30-floor Udan's Dungeon level in the quest mode. Toriyama Robo is not seen at any point in the game except at the very end of the dungeon. GAMEPLAY: Tobal No. 1 has various gameplay modes including a tournament mode, two player versus mode, practice mode, and the unique quest mode, all of which utilize the same fighting system. The game itself runs at up to a smooth 60 frames per second due to its lack of textured polygons and reduced details which gave the game a distinctive look in comparison to other fighting games at the time, such as Tekken 2. The game's controls are unique in that they allow full freedom of movement in the ring as long as the player faces the opponent. The player has the ability to dash and jump, and certain buttons execute high, medium, and low attacks for each character. Tobal No. 1 also has an intuitive grappling and blocking system, offering the player a variety of throws and counter moves. Perhaps the most distinctive feature of Tobal No. 1 is the "Quest Mode", which combines the game's fighting controls with three-dimensional dungeon exploration. The player must advance down a number of floors, contend with traps, and engage in fights with a variety of enemies including the game's playable characters. Several items can be found, dropped by enemies, or bought using crystals. These items can be picked up, consumed, or thrown at enemies, and include foodstuffs that can restore the player's HP or potions that have a range of effects including raising the player's maximum health or bringing it down to 1 point. There is no way to save one's progress, and dying means starting over from the beginning. Defeating certain characters in this mode unlocks them as playable characters in the game's other modes. Each of the eight initially playable characters can perform high, medium, and low attacks, and the game makes use of a grappling and blocking system that lets players execute a variety of throws and counterattacks. Features: Featuring such modes of play as "Tournament," "Vs.," and "Quest" Kick, punch, guard, jump, dash, and attack your way through the darkness of a dungeon to locate the Molmoran Select from 11 different characters including Emperor Udan, Nork, Hom, Epon, and Oliems</desc>

		<name>Titan Wars</name>
		<desc>Titan Wars (known as Solar Eclipse in Saturn) is a 3D shooter that takes place on and near the many moons of Saturn. You are a hot-shot pilot with a troubled past. You've been re-assigned to a new squadron aboard a Tomlinson-class carrier. There's trouble on a mining colony on the moon Janus. Your squadron is sent in to investigate, and uncover a lot more than they went looking for. Titan Wars plays kind of like a sequel to Total Eclipse for the 3DO. Gameplay is pure arcade-style shooter. You can view the game from a behind-the-ship perspective, or an in-cockpit perspective, but the scrolling is on rails. You can only travel in one direction. In each of the 9 missions you will find wave after wave of enemy ships, and a powerful boss ship at the end. The story in this game is told through a series of full-motion video clips. In addition to between-level scenes, FMV messages from your squad mates appear from time to time while you play the game.</desc>

		<desc>In the future, gang warfare is settled between gangs by using advanced armored vehicles. A mysterious figure called the Crimelord has set up a tournament on a secluded island dubbed "The Death Ring" to get all the gangs to fight each other to earn his favor. It's up to the player to take their gang to the top by infiltrating all the opposing gang's bases of operation and take out their network of power generators which will effectively cripple those opposing factions. Gameplay is centered around vehicular combat. Bases are defended by enemy vehicles, gun turrets, and mortars which harass the player while they are searching for the power generators to destroy. Players choose a vehicle (which represents a gang) with each coming with their own distinctive weapons such as shield draining bombs, energy megabolts, corrosive sulfur gas bombs and, mini-thermonuclear warheads. Each of the 23 missions contain power-ups such as invulnerability, invisibility, double damage, nitro boosts, and guided missile lock jammers. Powerups are earned after collecting a number of tokens scattered throughout each mission. There is also a 2 player split screen combat mode where two players can fight against each other.</desc>

Instead of the horrific beast the legend describes, the protagonist of the title is cute purple creature with long-ears and small wings. Dr. Knarf -- the villain of the piece -- has created a legion of mutated vegetables to do his evil bidding, and it falls to Jersey Devil to stop the maniacal scientist. To do this, the purple protagonist must venture through a series of 3D platform stages spread across themed environments such as a museum, cemetery, forest, and even a haunted house. Endowed with an ample set of abilities, Jersey Devil must jump, glide, and tail whip his way through the hordes of vegetables and undead minions, the latter comprising such mainstays as zombies, bats, and spiders.</desc>

Players can customize such details as fighting style, toughness, and even glove weight to find a fighter who matches their preferences. Guide your kickboxer from a rookie beginner to a contender for the heavyweight title. A two-player mode allows rivals to face-off in head-to-head bouts. At the onset of the game, only four of these fighters are available, but by beating opponents in the game's somewhat cheesy Story mode, gamers will eventually have 14 fighters to choose from. After completing the daunting task that is Story mode, players will have an even better time competing in the game's primary Ranking mode. Here they must fight anywhere between three and 12 fighters to win the title belt and gain valuable experience points. After winning a title, they can then defend their title to gain more points or open up new championship tournaments. While there are no rewarding endings or additional special characters to be earned, Ranking Mode is enjoyable enough to bring players back again and again.</desc>

This title features digitized graphics of 8 WWF superstars: Doink, Razor Ramon, Bret "Hit Man" Hart, Shawn Michaels, The Undertaker, Yokozuna, Bam Bam Bigelow, and Lex Luger. Although presented as a wrestling title, this game is structured like a one-on-one fighter, features over-the-top special moves characteristic of WWF. Each match is divided into a series of rounds, much like a fighting game. Instead of each round ending in a KO, it simply ends when the player forces the other wrestler(s) to fall by reducing their energy meter. Game modes include single player arcade mode, tournament mode, and versus mode for one-on-one multiplayer. Step into the ring with eight of the biggest stars in the WWF including Brett The Hitman Hart and the Undertaker. Wear down the opposition with standard wrestling moves, and then climb the ropes for some high-flying action. If you are taking a beating, you can quickly turn things around by using one of the character-specific special moves. Try to stake your claim on the championship belt in WWF WRESTLEMANIA: The Arcade Game. FEATURES: - Eight WWF stars - Wear down the opposition with standard wrestling moves - Climb the ropes for some high-flying action - Character-specific special moves - Stake your claim on the championship belt</desc>

The Thiima had been aroused by the Amnelian army's use of the weapon A.N. (All-Nothing) to annihilate the world Blazar, whom Amnelia had been at war with over jurisdiction over the moon Mahsah. Determined to protect their existence, and long ago programmed to protect the universe from just such threats as A.N., the Thiima swarmed on Amnelia. Although the armed forces were badly ravaged, Amnelian scientists and engineers were able to make use of both A.N. and reverse engineered Thiiman technology/life systems to create the Silver Hawk fighters. Ultimately, two pilots "Sameluck Raida and Lutia Feen" are chosen to perform a decisive attack on the main Thiima base: Kazumn, a satellite of the planet Darius.</desc>

		<name>Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six</name>
		<desc>Using a Tom Clancy storyline and characters, Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six for the PlayStation is an original first person 3D shooter where you take control of an elite counter-terrorist organization named Rainbow Six. After selecting one of three difficulty levels (beginner, intermediate or Special Forces), you select a team of operatives from a full roster. You can also equip your team with the appropriate weapons and equipment based on real-life munitions (even in Sniper Mode). To further realism you can select where each team member begins. After planning, lead your team into the mission where you get to control each member, one at a time. Also, as in real life, one shot may often maim or kill your operatives. If all of your operatives are killed, your mission ends. You must then choose to either move on with new operatives or retry the mission. If you complete all of your objectives you move on to the next mission for a total of 14 different missions in real world locations. In addition to the regular missions, you are also given the option to train. In the training level you can practice controlling an operative in a non-threatening environment. This is where you really get to learn some important skills. There is an assault course, a shooting range, and a training mission. Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six includes many real-life weapons. They include guns, grenades and kits. Some guns include: the HK MP5A2, the preferred submachine gun of counter-terrorist operatives around the world; the CAR-15, a compact M-16; and the Benelli M1, a good tactical shotgun that is an essential weapon for many teams. Other weapons include Frag Grenades, Heartbeat Sensors and Demolition Kits. Uniforms are another essential piece of equipment for counter-terrorists. Some include the ever-popular light, medium and heavy uniforms, the desert uniform, and the Camo uniform -- all used in different environments. The game also features real time lighting and special effects for ultimate realism.</desc>

		<name>Starfighter Sanvein</name>
		<desc>Sanvein is a fast-paced top down shooter where time is of the essence and every moment counts. The main computer of the self-sufficient space colony Utopia, called St. Schutz, has gone haywire. The goal of the game is to escape from Utopia. The game plays very differently from a normal space shooter. Each "floor" is made up of a series of interconnected rooms, and the player can choose any room adjacent to one they've cleared. For each adjacent room the player has cleared, their firepower in that room will be greater. Each floor has a number of boss rooms with a much larger and more dangerous enemy, each of which must be cleared to complete the floor. There is also a stronger power weapon which will recharge after use. All the while, a strict timer is counting down. When the player gets hit, instead of dying or taking damage, they lose time on the timer. The only way to get more time is to defeat a boss, so the player must balance between clearing rooms for greater firepower, and clearing bosses for more time. The game has a unique glitch-futuristic art style and five floors to play through. There are three ships and three weaponry systems to choose from.</desc>

		<name>The King of Fighters '99</name>
		<desc>The King of Fighters '99: Millennium Battle is a 1999 head-to-head fighting game by SNK released for the Neo Geo arcade and home platform. It is the sixth installment in the company's The King of Fighters series. The game was ported to the Neo-Geo CD and the PlayStation as the final KOF game released for both platforms. A Dreamcast version was also released under the title The King of Fighters '99 Evolution in which the stages look exactly the same as compared with the arcade counterpart only to be exclusively, remodeled into 3D rendered. Both the Neo Geo and Dreamcast versions are included in The Kings of Fighters NESTS Hen compilation released for the PlayStation 2 in Japan. The game introduces several changes to the established KOF format, as well as a new story arc that would later be dubbed the "NESTS Chronicles". PLOT: Two years have passed since the last King of Fighters tournament and nobody has seen Kyo Kusanagi or Iori Yagami since they defeated Orochi at the climax of the 1997 tournament, but out of the blue, new invitations are sent out to many characters, inviting them to a brand new tournament, though this competition is more of a secretive affair than the ones in '96 and '97. Unlike in previous games of the series, there are four characters per team instead of three. In total, there are seven teams, each containing four characters, four Team Edit characters and a boss. PLAYSTATION VERSION: The 1999 edition of the The King of Fighters series made the rounds from the arcade to the Neo Geo and Dreamcast before finding its way to the PlayStation console with this release. Players choose a team of three warriors and take on all challengers in this classically styled 2D fighter from the veterans at Agetec and SNK. Though based heavily on earlier versions of The King of Fighters '99, this PlayStation game adds new features designed to especially appeal to fans of the series, such as voice and picture galleries and a color edit mode that allows players to change the appearance of their favorite characters. Features: The King of Fighters '99 adds one new character to the roster of 32 New to the series are Striker Matches where characters jump into matches to save teammates Gallery mode features a variety of artwork, demo animations and voice samples</desc>

		<desc>Vandal Hearts is a turn-based strategy RPG. It follows a fixed plot-line with set battles, focusing more on strategic elements than adventure elements. The combat takes place in a series 3D grid based maps and each character in the party has a certain amount of movements they can perform each turn. As the game progresses, other characters join and leave the party and as they increase in level they can progress along different paths of development. Between each battle there is a cut scene that develops the plot using the same 3D engine as the combat (and often the same areas). In between battles you have the opportunity to talk to people in cities as well as purchase different equipment for the up coming battles.</desc>

Players will be able to take control of Jotaro Kujo, his friends, and his enemies in this world hopping, globe spanning fighting fest. Now PlayStation gamers will be able to take a Stand and wallop their friends over the head with them in the comfort of their own home. This game offers much of the two dimensional fighting fare that Capcom is renowned for. It takes a side venture into new realms with the addition of your Stand partners however. When you whip out a special attack or some hits, a phantasmal apparition will appear to give you back up. Each one differs depending on the characters alignment along the Tarot spectrum, and players also have the ability to put their Stand into a more active role once they build up their Stand Gauge. Then your alter egos can weigh in and have the ability to set up painful chain combos and they enable special character abilities like double jumping and air attacks.</desc>

		<name>Vandal Hearts II</name>
		<desc>Vandal Hearts II is a turn based strategic RPG which is comparable to the more famous Fire Emblem series. Most of the gameplay consists of moving your party on 3D grid based maps in a way that will give you a strategic advantage over your enemies. The main difference between Vandal Hearts II and its predecessor is the change of the battle system. Unlike in Vandal Hearts you and your enemies issue the commands at the same time and then move simultaneously. That results in in completely new strategies and gives the game a unique touch. The story takes place in the already collapsed church state of Nirvadia, that was once formed by the religious leader St Nirvath, but eventually ceased to exist, because of several conflicts between unbelievers and local rulers.

Ele toca praticamente o mesmo que o primeiro, mas apresenta melhor animação, mais personagens jogáveis e um enredo mais profundo. Jedah, o "Senhor do Vampiro", convocou todos os Guerreiros da Noite para o seu reino para ser assimilado em seu ser. Claro, isso serve como uma ótima desculpa para ter mais lutas individuais ...

It seems that as an egg, Aladar was stolen and then accidentally dropped onto an island populated by lemurs. The colony took in the little dinosaur and raised him as their own. Players will get to take Aladar and his friends, Zini and Flia, on a journey across 12 different stages. Each of the friends possesses different abilities so players will have to exercise strategy and teamwork to navigate through each level. Want to smash a rock? You'll need Aladar's tail. If you need something airlifted, however, Flia is the only pteranodon in town. Players will have to avoid enemies and traps in this overhead 3D game while they gather items and accomplish level goals. Aladar wants to get back with his own species, but there are carnivores and other more pernicious things lying in wait.</desc>

His dog Snowy falls asleep and dreams about their past wild adventures. Tintin: Destination Adventure successfully combines five different quests and rolls them into one. It is based on these classic adventures; The Black Island, Land of Black Gold, Red Rackham's Treasure, Explorers on the Moon and Flight 714. You may have read these stories, but have you ever experienced them through Tintin's eyes? To join these adventures together, a dream sequence is used. Tintin is going to the presentation of Professor Calculus's new invention, but the new creation isn't working, as usual. Meanwhile, Snowy falls asleep and starts dreaming about the wild adventures that they have been on together. The gameplay in Tintin: Destination Adventure is as varied as the adventures themselves. Many of the 21 levels play completely differently to one another. The main genres incorporated are platform, flying, racing and several other bonus games. You'll need to be good at several diverse styles of gameplay if you want to complete this game. So travel to the desert, visit an exotic island and even go to the moon with your new friends Tintin and Snowy. Plenty of good fun to be had by all ages.</desc>

		<name>Point Blank 2</name>
		<desc>Point Blank 2 is the sequel to the now classic arcade game Point Blank, which was converted to the PlayStation in 1998. Using the Namco built GunCon (an arcade-like light gun), it offers 70 new shooting galleries, different party modes and a new single-player game. If you're playing single-player, you have a few options from which to choose. The arcade mode is simply 16 rounds (of either beginner, advanced or insane difficulty) selected randomly from the 70 different shooting galleries. You'll get to shave sheep by shooting off their wool, test your accuracy in one-shot, one-hit bouts and save Dr. Don and Dr. Dan from wacky situations. There is also an endurance mode in which you climb a tall tower to see how far you can get in three tries. Out is the old single-player role-playing game from the original and in is an action-packed adventure. There are four rides to choose from, each with their own theme (like a haunted house and a submarine). The objective is to gain clues to save the King's daughter. To get new players familiar with the game controls, there is also a practice mode. If you've got a friend or a group of friends, Point Blank 2 features a wide variety of different play modes. The arcade games are enabled as well as turf wars, tournaments and a team-play option. You can also give certain players handicaps or enable penalties. Up to 8 people can play by alternating Guncons. Point Blank 2 ships in two different packaging formats, one with a Guncon and one without.</desc>

Much like the first in the series, the sequel has plenty of high performance cars to choose from, including the McLaren F1 or Ferrari F50 and a few concept cars, each handling differently. Once you've beaten the six tracks, a new track is available to you. It's a fast paced racing game which is intended to play more like an arcade racer than a true simulation. The main difference between this and the previous Need for Speed game is in the tracks, with less open road tracks in this sequel. Also, there are no cops to chase you. However, the tracks available are have a range of detail, and some have changing weather conditions while you race.</desc>

It consists of more than 30 games, the first of which - a shoot 'em up - was Germany's most popular computer game in the early 2000s. Originally the star of an promotional campaign for undrinkable whiskey Jack Daniels, Moorhunh has starred in over thirty games during the years, including five kart racing games. Moorhen 3 - Chicken Chase gameplay is like the first Moorhuhn game, the hunter in front of the screen must shoot down as many grouse as possible in 90 seconds. This generates points. That's it. Simple, but effective! Once again, to bring on the full works! So Crazy Chicken was sent on holiday by the seaside, but it didn't get any peace and quiet there. But it was no longer the only victim. The Lesshuhn, its slightly moronic and therefore almost extinct country cousin, came to visit. Well, you have been warned: This fellow's far from bright.</desc>

Zan proceeds through enemies and challenges in each level to eventually reach the boss who he then battles in some form of specialized combat or pattern. Once the boss is defeated, Zan gets the chance to unleash as much punishment on his foe in 30 seconds as he can; higher damage values will change the finishing move he uses to slay his foe.</desc>

		<desc>After creating a massive world with vast oceans, landscapes and an infinite universe, God instituted human beings to keep his creation in order. Upon realization that man was mortally flawed with weaknesses and feelings, he created a mysterious force known as the Seru; these stone objects would aid humans in decisions and day to day functions. Worn as an apparel item, they granted the wearer many strengths and abilities ranging from the movement of heavy objects to flying capabilities. Thus, human life was made easier -- the Seru would forever obey their masters. And then the Mist arrived. Filled with destructive means and hatred, the Mist covered the human's cultivated lands and destroyed a seemingly eternal bond with the Seru. Instead of loyally helping their masters, the mysterious stones turned against the humans; they became maniacal tools of evil, controlling minds and ruining innocent lives. The human existence was reduced tremendously with few survivors fleeing to uncharted territories. Perhaps the Mist wouldn't find them wherever they ran.</desc>

The game featured characters from Taito games such as Rainbow Islands, Kiki Kaikai, Don Doko Don and The New Zealand Story, Based on the 1997 Taito arcade coin-op Gameplay: A collection of balloons are attached to clouds. The clouds move across the screen. When a column of balloons touches the edge of the screen, the clouds move down one level. The player controls a familiar for his character, not your character him/herself. The familiar can release pairs of balloons towards the clouds. If a group of at least three similarly-colored balloons touch each other, they pop! The goal of the game is to clear the screen of all balloons. If the balloons do not touch the clouds, they continue up to the top of the screen and disappear. As a penalty, the clouds will temporarily speed up. The player usually doesn't want to miss the clouds, but sometimes it's a good idea to. Any balloons below balloons that pop move upward. The player can create combos by causing balloons to move up and form new similarly-colored groups of balloons, which will then pop too. Playstation game modes: - Story mode: Play through your choice of branching levels,facing a boss after every fifth level. Recover something for the princess from "Don Doko Don".Beating this allows you to use Chackn. The final boss is the Super Dark Great Dragon from Bubble Memories and Rainbow Islands. When you beat him, you have to fight him again as a Skel. As Super Dark Great Dragon, he shoots several laser beams you have to dodge. As Skel, he lowers EVERY cloud when he "jumps", not just one. You have to beat Skel quickly! - 1 Player vs computer: Beating this allows you to use Hipopo. - 1 Player vs 2nd Player - Family Mode, Challenge Mode &amp; Checkmate mode.</desc>

		<name>The Powerpuff Girls : Chemical X-Traction</name>
		<desc>The Powerpuff Girls is an American animated television series created by animator Craig McCracken and produced by Hanna-Barbera (later Cartoon Network Studios) for Cartoon Network. The show centers on Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup, three kindergarten-aged girls with superpowers, as well as their "father", the brainy scientist Professor Utonium, who all live in the fictional city of Townsville, USA. The girls are frequently called upon by the town's childlike mayor to help fight nearby criminals using their powers. The Powerpuff Girls revolves around the adventures of Blossom,bubbles, and buttercup . Each of the girls has a color; Bubbles is blue, Buttercup is green and Blossom is pink. The plot of a typical episode is some humorous variation of standard superhero and tokusatsu fare, with the girls using their powers to defend their town from villains and giant monsters. In addition, the girls also have to deal with normal issues young children face, such as sibling rivalries, loose teeth, personal hygiene, going to school, bed wetting, or dependence on a security blanket. Episodes often contain more or less hidden references to older pop culture. Powerpuff Girls: Chemical X-traction is a 3D fighting adventure featuring characters from Craig McCracken's hugely successful Cartoon Network series. Help Bubbles dispense a little justice on the wily Mojo Jojo or guide Buttercup to deliver a nice knuckle sandwich to deserving Gangreen Gang members. In the story mode, players can pick up objects and throw them at an enemy to decrease their opponents health meter. They can use superpowered attacks by collecting vials of Chemical X. If the player successfully defeats the enemy in two out of three rounds, they move to the next enemy location. Players can play the story mode or can battle against a friend in a head-to-head battle.</desc>

		<desc>An ancient weapon of unknown origin was found in a German castle some fifty years ago. Since it was obviously something of value, it was decided that it would be awarded to the best fighter in the world. After all, who would appreciate a weapon more than an experienced fighter? Eleven of the world's finest combatants (including Cloud Strife, Tifa Lockhart and Vincent Valentine) have set out to claim this prize. The mysterious artifact came to be known as Ehrgeiz, and the tournament that was built around it took on the very same name. Now rumors suggest that the door to a long-forgotten land can be unlocked with this weapon; a land that could reveal the secret of immortality. The tournament has taken on a whole new meaning!</desc>

		<name>Tenchu : Stealth Assassins</name>
		<desc>After firing your grappling hook to the rooftop of a small house, you pull yourself up and notice a guard pacing back and forth on the ground. He doesn't see you as you begin to crawl and sneak around on the roof. If he detects your presence, you will be in a world of hurt; you will blow your mission and risk death. Patiently, you wait for the right time to jump down -- and end his life while his back is turned. Set in 16th century Japan, Tenchu: Stealth Assassins is a simulation of the ways of the stealthy ninja. You'll chose between two characters, Rikimaru and Ayame, with a main objective of remaining unseen throughout ten non-linear missions. You will move through the shadows, make your way across rooftops, dash through trees -- anything to cloak yourself from enemy sight. While completing the missions, you are judged on three levels that measure your success in the fields of elusiveness and effectiveness. Each mission is different in its design and goal. Your mentor will have you run secret errands to informants, kill evil merchants and thieves, and rescue captive ninjas. Along the way, the enemy resistance has set up traps and assigned guards to keep a watchful eye for any interference (that would be you). Because Tenchu is a simulation of sorts, running up and engaging an enemy combat is not advised -- that's not the way of the ninja. A ninja is cunning and in order to uphold his duty, he must remain unseen. If you brazenly walk up to a group of enemies and try to kill them all, you may get through a couple, but you will ultimately fail and dishonor your people. As far as weaponry goes, make use of throwing stars and actual ninja assassin swords. For the truly cunning players, poisoned rice and smoke bombs are included as special items. If a guard will not go away, try putting some rice down for him to eat - he'll get sick and collapse.</desc>

		<name>Patriotic Pinball</name>
		<desc>Australian developer Wildfire Studios changes its focus from big acts like KISS and Austin Powers to American history in Patriotic Pinball. Two tables, Road Trip Coast to Coast and America on Duty, offer seven missions apiece. In the former, missions include rush hour at the Golden Gate Bridge, Muscle Beach, Route 66, Las Vegas, New York, gold mines, and whitewater rafting. The second table features the destruction of Confederate cannons in the Civil War, boot camp, tracking enemy subs, capturing Hill 142, saving the wounded from Heartbreak Ridge, flying a B17 bombing run, and helping Uncle Sam. Patriotic Pinball features four gameplay modes: novice, regular, arcade and tournament. In novice mode, the ball saver remains active longer than in regular mode (5-ball play with extra balls, end-of-game matching, and a bonus round), while arcade mode offers only three balls with extras awarded based on score. Tournament mode eliminates the various extras (Wild Fireball, number matching, and points) and awards only extra balls as a bonus. Both tables track and save high scores to memory card.</desc>

		<desc>Set against the backdrop of an inter-galactic penal colony, Loaded sees players, as one of six psychotic inmates, attempting to navigate fifteen enemy-laden levels en route to their ultimate goal; the killing of the sadistic warden -- known as FUB (Fat Ugly Boy) -- of said penal colony. The characters, with names such as Butch, FWANK, Cap N Hands, Mamma, Bounca, and Vox run the gamut from cross-dressing freaks and cyborg pirates to demented clowns and female cyber-criminals. All are rated in a handful of categories; each possessing differing speed, vitality and damage potential attributes. Armed with their character's weapon of choice, up to two players can blast their way through stages populated by fellow inmates, guards, straight-jacket laden mental patients, rats, and more. While objectives are present, the basic formula amounts to scouring each level in search of color-coded keys that will allow you to advance further into the level, while blasting hostiles and collecting ammunition and health power-ups to replenish your reserves. A small on-screen map allows you to find your way through the maze-like stages.</desc>

Da América à Europa e ao Japão, esses guerreiros lutam entre si pela chance de obtê-lo. Soul Blade é um jogo de luta em 3D que narra sua história. Um jogo de luta em 3D completo que permite degraus laterais, o Soul Blade possui doze lutadores coloridos (dez padrão, dois ocultos e mais figurinos adicionais para alguns lutadores), cada um com várias armas e estilos. Os dez primeiros podem ser usados ​​em todos os modos de combate, enquanto os dois ocultos só podem ser usados ​​nos modos versus e arcade. A Namco aprimorou a versão arcade (chamada Soul Edge) adicionando uma introdução CGI bem-feita, além de um modo de história à adição dos modos tradicionais de equipe, sobrevivência e ataque de tempo. O modo história entra em maiores detalhes sobre cada personagem e é apresentado em um formato de livro antigo. O modo história também permite que você desbloqueie mais armas extras de cada personagem. Essas armas, que variam em tamanho, estatísticas e durabilidade, aumentam as opções disponíveis para os jogadores no modo versus.

You see, he's basically a boogie-man who has the power to entrap people in their own nightmares forever. Fortunately, there are two brave souls out there ready to fight Swagman face to face. Their names are Zac and Hannah, two 8 year old twins. Swagman is a combination of the platform and adventure genre. While in the "Real World", the game is adventure-like; find and collect items and/or keys to open certain doors. When you enter the dream sequences, called the Territories, the game becomes a platform game. The combination of genres and the whole real world/dream world is a neat idea and throw in some nice, cartoonish and highly colorful graphics and you've got a nifty little game. Features: - Help twins Zack and Hannah escape a nightmarish world - Explore six levels to defeat the evil Swagman - Use Warp Circles to change positions</desc>

		<name>Yetisports Deluxe</name>
		<desc>Yetisports (also known as Pingu Throw) is a web-based Flash game that originally appeared on the Internet in January 2004. The goal of the original game is to have a yeti smack a penguin with a club and try to get it fly as far as possible. The original Yetisports game features no name other than the words "1978 Reinhold + Yeti", a reference to Reinhold Messner's claim to have found Yetis. The game is humorous and addictive at the same time and therefore very popular on the Internet. Very soon after release, there was a quick succession of many variants created by multiple people on the internet. None of these are officially sponsored by Chris Hilgert, even though many copy the original almost exactly save certain small changes. One of the more violent variants was made by someone known as 'Pawel', featuring decapitation, spikes, a big spiky club and mines. Since the original was released at the Yetisports homepage, the website has released nine further adventures of the Yeti as well as a re-release of the original that allows movement of the penguin in flight. Yetisports Deluxe in his Playstation release is a compilation of the simple but popular web-based games, with new ones added for the commercial release. Featured games include Super Pingu Throw, Ice Bear Attack and Pengu Dart. Also featured in the PC version are the four original Flash-based Yetisports games!</desc>

He answered the phone and was greeted with some bad news -- his father's home had caught on fire and the old man was missing. Accompanied by a policeman, Richard returned to the house to investigate and find any clues he could of his father's disappearance or the fire. As he was sifting through the ashes and debris, he came across an old key for the grandfather clock. He inserted the key into the clock and opened up a secret passage. Startled, he entered the passage only to find a large red book telling of the Rockwell dynasty. The family, as well as 45 other people, had vanished one year ago aboard the luxury boat Orpheus.</desc>

What makes the game (and the real-life counterpart) distinct from wrestling, boxing, and other fights is the variety of fighting styles in use; it is perfectly possible to end up with a judo master facing a kickboxer. The actual gameplay is simple enough. You have various basic moves, combos, holds, and so on. The complications come in the form of the huge list of moves, featuring many different styles. Hit your opponent until he gets knocked out, or force him to tap out early. There are multiple game modes included. Among them are a survival mode, that has you face a string of enemies with minimal recovery, and career mode, which allows you to customize and improve your fighting style as you win fights.</desc>

		<desc>Grid Runner is a futuristic version of "tag." On offense, your objective is to capture the flags around the levels without being tagged or killed. On defense, your main objective is to tag the other player (either the computer or a friend in two-player mode) before he or she collects all the flags. In each level you will find different colored balls that will help you defeat your enemies. For example, the green balls increase your speed, red increases your magic, and blue increases your agility. The more power-ups you collect, the more efficient you become. You can also use and collect magic points. Collecting magic points allows you to do one of six things: build a temporary bridge, drop explosives behind you, slow down your opponent, fire a weapon (which can be upgraded or traded), temporarily boost your speed, or teleport out of danger.</desc>

The goal is to complete the most laps around the famous Le Mans track in a 24-hr. period. In Le Mans, the player is offered a choice of three different car classes. On the one hand, we have the GT2 class. It is the easiest of the group, offering a good level of handing. The second type is the GT1. The GT1 cars are designed with professional racing in mind. Although difficult to control, these cars are the most powerful of the classes. Only an experienced driver can handle the GT1 class. Finally, we have the Prototype class of car. These vehicles lie slightly below the GT1 in terms of performance. Le Mans offers a number of play modes. The Arcade mode is designed for a quick thrill. It can satisfy the action junkies need for an adrenaline high. In it, the cars are completely indestructible, putting the emphasis on the racing. As the name implies, the Challenge races offer a bunch of difficult obstacles to overcome. Beating the opponent cars will open up a new series of Challenge tracks. The Time Attack mode pits the racer against the clock. Victory in the Time Attack mode will unleash a new fleet of cars. The Championship mode is a little bit deeper. In it, the player will participate in an entire racing season, culminating in the famous 24 Heures Du Mans. The Championship mode starts with the GT2 class of car. Upon beating the first series of races, the player will be able to move on to the other car types. Finally, Le Mans offers the Le Mans 24 hr mode. In game time, the Le Mans race lasts the entire 24-hr. period. The player can choose to shorten the outcome by resetting the game time. Be careful, though, as the car can take a lot of damage in a long race. Le Mans offers a split screen multi-player mode. In addition, it supports the Dual Shock Analog Controller and the Memory Card. Features: * 3 play modes: arcade, simulation, and endurance * Authentic Le Mans circuit tracks * 24 officially licensed racing teams * Day and night driving conditions * Dual Shock Controller support</desc>

		<name>Tennis Arena</name>
		<desc>With no stat tweaking and no licenses, Tennis Arena is arcade-style tennis at its most fundamental. What you have here is single-match or tournament play for up to four players with wacky characters and a few different courts to play on. You can play an obese Chinese man, for example, and compete in a Roman coliseum whose clay surface seems to affect bounce marginally. That's about it for options though. No sim, Tennis Arena serves up roughly the same level of fun as Pong did 25 years ago, albeit now with prettier graphics and the occasional super smash. The game also features special shots, with visible trails, fighter-plane-like sound effects, and higher ball speed. These must be earned however. After successfully returning the ball over the net six consecutive times, a yellow star appears under the character. You may then attempt to use the special shot, which entails lining up with the ball just right - but a failed special shot doesn't erase the stored potential.</desc>

		<name>Grand Theft Auto</name>
		<desc>In Grand Theft Auto, you assume the role of a street thug working for an organized syndicate of criminals that specializes in stealing cars. Every time your pager beeps, the boss needs you to steal something for him -- if you don't get to a payphone and answer the message, you'll be in hot water (or is that cold water at the bottom of the East River). After receiving your mission, you'll have to navigate city streets that are bustling with pedestrians, cops (your worst enemies), and traffic jams. Because you're pressed for time, you can't just walk to your destination on foot -- that would take too long. Instead, you'll have to go car jacking, the art of physically removing people out of their vehicles and stealing it. This is the premise behind Grand Theft Auto, an overhead action game of thievery. There are four large cities in which you'll have to steal cars, shoot rival gang members, and complete missions for the boss. Each mission requires you to get something from point "A" to point "B". For example, the head honcho wants to pull off a bank heist -- instead of using regular cars, they want you to steal a couple taxicabs for them. This way, the cops won't be able to find them as easily in traffic.</desc>

		<desc>Largo Winch, the "billionaire in blue jeans," is based on the character created by novelist Jean van Hamme, now popular in France in the form of comic strips and a television series. Much like Lara Croft and James Bond, the rich, sophisticated, tough, agile, and cunning Winch is thrust into situations that only a top commando could handle. In Largo Winch.// Commando SAR, players guide Largo on a quest to track down terrorists, who are threatening his financial empire, and rescue a young journalist, Tania Kournakova, who was kidnapped from his Venezuelan chemical factory. Members of the South American Redemption (SAR) have been blackmailed by a rival corporation and forced to commit acts against Largo's empire by the evil Mrs. Fritz. Now, Winch must use his fists, a pistol, and semi-retrievable (only if they miss the target) throwing knives in conjunction with gadgets like a brainwave scanner for locating enemies, a radio (for hints and messages from friends), and his toolkit. His arsenal, combined with stealthy movement, helps the jet-set commando put an end to the conspiracy facing him in his first PlayStation adventure.</desc>

The three friends must now travel to a place called "Wishing Engine", and be granted a wish to revert the world back to normal. The characters each have a special movement to kill enemies with.

The goal of the game is to clear the various levels, avoiding spikes and enemies and collecting coins for extra lives. Unlike most 3D platformers, Pandemonium offers only two-dimensional movement, rather than complete freedom of movement. The characters move along a curving 2D course within a 3D environment.</desc>

		<name>Looney Tunes Racing</name>
		<desc>Looney Tunes Racing is a kart-racing game for the PlayStation. There are some definite similarities between this title and Crash Team Racing, both in game play mechanics and depth. Completely immersed in the humor and soul of the Looney Tunes license, the player starts the game with only a handful of characters and levels available, but as the game proceeds features become unlocked including new characters, levels, and challenges. Each character has an unique vehicle themed just for them, and is accompanied by voice taunts, provided by Warner Bros. licensed voice actors, and character-specific animations that help bring these characters to life. The weapons the player can unleash onto the opponents include cherry bombs, homing cream pies, thunder clouds with devastating lightning bolts, and giant anvils that drop out of the sky. In addition, each uniquely themed level has a series of amusing booby traps and obstacles that the player can unleash to slow down your foes. The player can make boulders fall, launch giant boxing gloves on springs, and trample the opponents with sheep in the red-rock canyons, get spacecraft to fire lasers in the Martian level, and activate a huge, fat, white horse in the Opera stage to come in and trounce on the enemies. Even Gossamer, the large monster make entirely of red hair (except for those big white eyes and white tennis shoes), makes a cameo in the Gossamer’s castle level, as he comes right out onto the track to take out any oncoming traffic. Beyond the races, other noteworthy game modes include the Multi-player Battle Mode, where the players basically pummel each other with wacky weaponry, and the ACME Challenges, which include challenges such as Boss Races (against Porky Pig, for example), picking up key items in a certain order, and others.</desc>

		<desc>Grab your Chakram and sword, because the evil sorceress Kalabrax has broken free after centuries of imprisonment. She will finally get her revenge upon the gods who imprisoned her and the world they created. Only one thing is stopping her. In order for her spell to gain ultimate power to work she must sacrifice a queen. Unfortunately for Xena, it would appear that Gabrielle is the sacrifice de jour, being Queen of the Amazons and all. So with the help of her allies, who just happen to be Xena's bitter enemies, she has captured Gabrielle and it's up to Xena, Warrior Princess to save her. It won't be easy though. Nothing for Xena ever is. She will have to journey far and wide before she can face Kalabrax. She must defeat the vile King Valarian and his cronies as well as Narsus the evil renegade Amazon, and a host of other creatures like a cyclops and dragon just to name a few. Developed by Universal Studios Digital Arts, Xena: Warrior Princess is one experience you won't forget as you must defeat all the enemies on a stage, solve puzzles and save a few hapless villagers before you can continue on your journey. You have all of Xena's trademark moves and weapons at your disposal, including her classic warrior scream. Will it be enough to save Gabrielle from becoming an ingredient in Kalabrax's evil spell? Can you save the world? Do you really want to save the gods? There's really no choice; you must stop Kalabrax before all you hold dear crumbles in an instant. Safe journey! Battle on, Xena...</desc>

As the transport ship reaches the Pantheon base, though, the ship crashes at the landing site, freeing Hulk to smash, destroy, and get revenge on his captors. Hulk can hit and kick opponents, windows, walls, and anything else that gets in his way. He is also capable of a variety of special moves including a booming Sonic Clap, a shattering Floor Smash, and a sweeping Vortex Spin.</desc>

The story goes that every five thousand years a door is opened between dimensions. One dimension is our universe, and the other is the anti-universe. This universe is known as Pure Evil, and waits for the doors to open, since every five thousand years the four basic elements (earth, air, fire, water) are gathered around the fifth the perfect being (Leeloo). The two characters have different options available to them. Korben can use guns, while Leeloo can use grenades. This helps you in certain aspects of the game, and choosing your character wisely can mean the difference between life and death.</desc>

Slap Happy Rhythm Busters, aside from having this wacky title, on its core is a 2D fighting game with 3D manga-shaded characters. The end result is very good, and looks exactly like Viewtiful Joe. But there is more. The word "rhythm" in the title has to have a meaning, right? And it does have. At the heat of a fight, if your Special Bar is completely full, you can perform a Beat Combo. It is basically like if Beatmania for some crazy reason, were implemented in a fighting game. By performing a Beat Combo, you will have to rhythmically press in turn one of the four frontal buttons of the directional pad, according to the beat. And it is amazing to see this in a fighting game.</desc>

		<name>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4</name>
		<desc>The fourth game in Activision and Neversoft's seminal skateboarding series is designed to bring additions and refinements to the already polished gameplay that's made Tony Hawk's Pro Skater one of the most important video game franchises of its time. Many of these improvements are in line with advances made in earlier THPS sequels, while others may come as a surprise to longtime fans of the series. Environments are designed to seem even larger and more interactive in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4, with less worry over time limits and more emphasis on exploration. The game also adds new tricks to the pro skaters' repertoires, allowing huge, point-packed combos. The "spine transfer" challenges skaters to zip up one side of a double ramp and down the other. Players will trick off of moving cars and other interactive elements of the game's diverse levels with new finesse.</desc>

		<name>Lucifer Ring</name>
		<desc>In true fairy tale style, evil is about to lay its dark shadow over the world. The only way to stop this from happening is to collect 4 magic rings. Cue Nash, generic hero. Equipped with a sword and a limited amount of magic he sets out to slash, hack and slice his way to the 4 rings and in the end, a much nicer world to live in. Lucifer Ring plays much like Golden Axe but in full 3D, where Nash walks along a linear path and is constantly confronted by monsters who want nothing more than to end his life. Every now and then the player is given an opportunity to choose paths to get from point A to point B in several ways. At the end of every stage there is a boss waiting for Nash to make his day just a little less sunny and cheerful. In other words, they are usually evil and need plenty of killing. Nash has two standard attacks, one harder (but slower) and one weaker (but faster). Nash also has the ability to jump to cross broken bridges, cliffs and other natural hazards. A meter at the top of the screen fills up as Nash kills enemies and when it is full the player will be able to unleash a very powerful attack, which usually kills all the enemies on the screen. You are Nash. Hack your way through several levels inthe land of Friesia acquiring elemental swords along the way to use against your enemies on your way to Hell's Gate.</desc>

Players will race through locations based on San Francisco cities, rural areas, and suburban neighborhoods. Environments can also be cycled through day, night, and snow conditions in order to add some variety and challenge to the racing action. Players can alter their view of their car from a third-person perspective to a first-person view looking through the windshield. There are eight available cars to choose from that vary in speed and control as well as four difficulty levels (Beginner, Advanced, Expert, and Extreme). The higher the difficulty, the more control is sacrificed in order to increase the maximum speed. Car colors can also be customized to your liking, and there is a choice between manual and automatic gear transmissions.</desc>

		<name>WWF SmackDown!</name>
		<desc>THQ managed to wrest the WWF license away from Acclaim for no less than ten years (as of 2000). THQ then went to the respected Japanese wrestling game developer Yuke's Co., Ltd, who produces the Toukon Retsuden series, and told them to make a game worthy of The Rock. WWF SmackDown! was the result of this collaboration. Based on the prime time UPN WWF television show that made its debut in September of 1999, WWF SmackDown! tries to capture all elements of the typical WWF broadcast. While all the usual mayhem involved within the ring is present, including a Season mode, I Quit matches, Falls Count Anywhere and the like, the game takes a more global approach to the WWF as it also offers a story mode. Now you'll be able to directly experience the backstage drama that is an integral part of a WWF broadcast. You'll develop rivalries, make allies and try to defend your best interests. You'll be get the chance to play as over 30 of the top WWF superstars from the year 2000. Your superstar of choice will be able to make a bold entrance thanks to the authentic Titantron footage that plays before the wrestler makes their entrance. The attitude will be thick in the arena after a win thanks to the authentic post-match victory poses and exit themes. You'll also get to create your own wrestlers with the Create a Wrestler Mode, and unlock hidden personalities and wrestlers during extended Season mode play. Players will also get a variety of arenas and backstage areas to face off in as they enter the Smackdown Hotel. You'll be able to feel the electricity as you throw your opponent up the ramp and drag his pathetic carcass off to the kitchen, the parking lot, or even the boiler room. So know your role and get ready to bow down to the masters. The people's game has arrived, so get ready to "layeth the smacketh down" on the entire WWF roster present in the game. To be in the game, you have to beat the game. Features: - Play through the story and make decisions that alter the story, tag teams and rivalries - Taunt your opponent with signature moves and mannerisms of WWF wrestlers - Create your own master of the ring by adjusting moves and personality variables with sliding scales</desc>

		<desc>Kamen Rider (translated as Masked Rider, is a weekly sci-fi story created by Japanese mangaka Shotaro Ishinomori. It debuted as a tokusatsu television series on April 3, 1971 and ran until February 10, 1973, airing on the Mainichi Broadcasting System and NET TV (now TV Asahi). A manga adaptation was also featured in Shonen Magazine around the same period. Although each entry in the series is different, each one shares similar traits with one and another. All generally involve at least one young adult male transforming into a Kamen Rider to fight various monsters and organizations linked to that specific Kamen Rider's origin. As the series progresses, the Rider often learns more about the monsters in the series, other Kamen Riders or the origin of his powers. Early Kamen Riders were generally based on grasshoppers, but this practice has only been done twice in the newer set of shows.</desc>

		<desc>Inuyasha: A Feudal Fairy Tale is a 2D fighting game starring characters from Rumiko Takahashi's manga and anim? series, Inuyasha. The story centers around 15-year old high school student Kagome Higure, who inadvertently slips back in time to feudal Japan, where she becomes embroiled in a quest to locate shards of the Sacred Jewel of the Four Souls. "Feudal Fairy Tale," the game's main mode of play, follows this escapade and requires players to engage in a series of battles and mini-games in order to obtain the coveted shards. Initially, only Kagome and her half-demon companion Inuyasha are playable, but as players journey through the game, acquiring shards, more characters become available. Each character is able to perform both strong and weak attacks, as well as throws and counter attacks. Players can also execute more powerful combination maneuvers, including special and super attacks, which can only be initiated when the Spiritual meter is filled. Additionally, specific attacks can cause opponents to drop shards that, once claimed, will fill the Spiritual meter more quickly.</desc>

		<desc>Based on the popular computer chess program, The Chessmaster 3-D for the PlayStation allows players to challenge a friend or one of 12 virtual chess opponents. Each computer-controlled opponent is rated according to ability. There are also six unique chess sets (each with animated pieces) from which to choose, including Alphabet, Celestial, Deco, Mechanical, Modern, and Staunton. If you need assistance in deciding which pieces to move in order to secure a checkmate, the ChessMaster is available to lend a helping hand. You can perfect your chess playing skills using various teaching options; you can even view the computer's thought process as it "thinks" through each move. While this is obviously a 3D title, you can switch the camera angle for a more traditional two-dimensional perspective. The camera is adjustable in that you're able to zoom it in and out until you find a view that is to your liking. You can even switch playing sides (from black to white pieces or vise versa) or simply have a quick look at the other side of the board. If you want to see which pieces have been captured, you can view them in the War Room. The Chessmaster 3-D also features various time controls (five seconds per move, 40 moves in 120 minutes), replays, take back options, and auto play (which lets the game play itself). Features: Challenge the computer or a friend on a 3D table with adjustable levels of zoom Features 12 computer AI opponents Access hints while playing and view replays of key moves</desc>

		<name>The Next Tetris</name>
		<desc>It's Tetris, only... new. The Tetris series returns to its roots, eschewing the Disney characters, 3D pieces, hats, and letters that have been tacked on previous entries. Contains the standard Tetris game, as well as some variants. Some of the new features are puzzle pieces made of individual parts- after a piece lands, some parts may be able to break off and continue down; &amp;quot;wiggly&amp;quot; pieces that not only provide trippy eye-candy, but may allow you to squeeze a big piece through a tight spot; challenge modes where you must clear a cluttered playfield with limited time/pieces. Allows for solo or competitive simultaneous play. Also links to a global board via the Internet to compare scores and times.</desc>

		<name>Wild 9</name>
		<desc>Wild 9 is a 2D platformer with 3D graphics, featuring gameplay similar in vein to the company's 2D Earthworm Jim games. Unique to Wild 9 is the 'rig', a weapon your character wields to carry enemies to torture and maim them to solve puzzles and progress through the game's ten levels. Basically, it's an interesting twist and homage to more old-school Super NES video gaming.</desc>

		<name>Mortal Kombat : Special Forces</name>
		<desc>Why do people hate? What causes such intense animosity that a person would go to any length to hurt someone, perhaps even destroy them? These are just a few questions posed by the relationship of Jax and Kano. Is it because Jax is a Special Forces agent and must bring Kano to justice? Could it be that simple? Would it justify following him to another realm and becoming involved in the Mortal Kombat competition? Can hate make you so blind that you'd face demons in hopes of facing the one man you truly want to destroy? Greater yet is the mystery of how Kano became involved with Shang Tsung and the significance of the Black Dragon. So many questions left unanswered, so many things seemingly left to chance. At least until now... In Mortal Kombat Special Forces by Midway, you play as Jax. Your mission is to destroy Kano and his army of thugs, but it won't be easy. You have to explore 3D environments from a third-person perspective and find hidden areas. Punch, kick, and shoot your way through the droves of enemies you'll face. Watch out for thugs armed with guns and other weapons trying to snuff out your life before you can get to your true objective. Be sure to pay close attention to incoming messages. They will give hints and help you solve the riddle of hate. They may even lead you to some secret places too. Collect items and weapons in order to increase your firepower and fill your health meter -- there is even a sniper rifle for some long distance attacks. Amass experience points and learn new and devastating combo moves. Pull off one of those combos at the right time, and witness a gruesome fatality. Can you overcome your hatred? Or will you be another fatality?</desc>

		<desc>Spider-Man 2 - Enter: Electro is the second PlayStation game to feature Spider-Man, and also serves as the sequel to the 2000 video game Spider-Man. This game follows Spider-man as he attempts to stop his old enemy Electro from obtaining a source of power called the Bio-Nexus Device. Game bosses included Hammerhead, Lizard, Sandman, Shocker and the exclusive charged-up Hyper-Electro. This sequel to Activision's 2000 multi-platform Spider-Man release features the title villain in a diabolical scheme to construct a device that will amplify his strange electricity-based powers and make him virtually unstoppable. Players take the role of their friendly neighborhood Spider-Man to foil Electro's plan before it's too late. Movement and camera angles are similar to those of the first Spider-Man game, though Spidey has a few new web-slinging abilities in this title and is challenged by some sophisticated puzzle-solving and complex action sequences. Once again, Marvel Comics' legendary Stan Lee provides narration for this adventure.</desc>

		<desc>Small Soldiers is a third-person action game released at the same time as the movie of the same name. Instead of dealing with the toy Commandos and Gorgonites from the movie, the game uses the characters in an imaginary environment as described on the back of the toy figures' packaging. It has fourteen levels of single-player action some featuring the Gorgonite Archer, others featuring the commando Chip Hazard. You assume the role of Archer, who has to defend his world against an invasion of the commandos. You can run, jump, climb ledges and fight using a blaster. Many levels involve freeing captured Gorgonites who then help you fight. Multiplayer includes two head-to-head two-player Chip vs. Archer mode where you either need to capture flags or get a set amount of frags.</desc>

Combining speed with elements from the previous title, players take their scooters and hit one of three locales in an attempt to become a racing legend. Each location (city streets, mall, and an industrial compound) is composed of three separate sections. In the first round, players qualify for the race by completing three laps within the allotted time. Next, players race by challenging two other opponents in a three-lap challenge. Completing these two objectives will open up the area's skatepark, and by beating the park's overall score, a new member will be added to the racing team.</desc>

		<name>Grand Theft Auto 2</name>
		<desc>The game takes place at an undisclosed time in the near future. Unlike the first game which featured three different cities, Grand Theft Auto 2 only features a single town, but it's divided in three districts which are unlocked one at a time: downtown, residential and industrial. Like in the original the player goes around answering phones to initiate various missions. The game uses an overhead camera in a 3D landscape and allows the player to freely explore the city and steal any vehicle the player sets his or her eyes on. To unlock new districts the player must reach a certain score which is done by committing crimes and finishing missions. Because the game now features multiple criminal gangs, the player must choose allegiances. Performing missions for one gang, will decrease the player's reputation for another. When the player commits crimes he also becomes wanted by the local police, but as more crimes are committed without shaking the police, they will give way for first SWAT Teams, then Special Agents and finally the army. New features include the ability to save at the church, when donating enough money, and various side missions, such as becoming a taxi driver to ear money. There are also many new cars with weapons attached such as a firetruck with a flamethrower and a car with machine guns.</desc>

The gameplay is mostly the same as the original Dropzone although it features some new weapons and end of level boss fights. The player controls a spaceman with a jetpack and can fly in all directions above the moon surface while killing wave after wave of aliens. At the same time the player has to protect the ten people that are assigned to the moon by taking them to the dropzone landing pad. The action takes place on the moons mentioned above as well as on Jupiter itself. At the last level on each moon the player has to defeat a planet guardian. To do this the player has to hit them in their glowing green nerve centre that is exposed at times as they move around. Each wave starts with all remaining humans being beamed up by a leader enemy and to release the men it has to be defeated.</desc>

Players choose one of several classically styled muscle cars and hot rods to drive in freewheelin' races across the good ol' U. S. of A. Winners receive the singular reward of a chance to "hang out" with attractive Hooters Girls waitress characters, known to patrons of the owl-mascotted restaurant chain for their friendly service and distinguishingly informal "short shorts and short shirt" uniforms. The game features well over a dozen different automobiles, though many of these must be "unlocked" by skillful play. Races take place across the country in such fair weather locations as Florida and California. In the words of the restaurant's own slogan, "Delightfully Tacky, Yet Unrefined."</desc>

The strategic challenge comes in using the limited space and available pipe pieces to create a conduit that will take the ever-flowing ooze where it needs to be. As the player progresses through the game's 18 levels, additional barriers and obstacles compound the challenge. Pipe Dreams 3D is a three-dimensional remake of the classic puzzle game Pipe Dream. This remake/revision includes characters, different continents, new obstacles, and a story-driven mode.</desc>

Unlike many ninjas before him, he is able to summon powers of the arcane; magical spells that do great damage to those cast upon. And he'll need it - the world has been cast into utter darkness in which monsters and creatures from the beyond roam. There are four different worlds broken into 11 distinctive levels - Kurosawa will travel throughout cemeteries, rocky mountain terrain, coastal areas, deep and dark forests, etc. The goal in each is to survive, which is often easier said than done. As alluded to earlier, monsters (such as goblins) are out for your blood - even fellow ninjas who've turned to the dark side will meet you with resistance.</desc>

		<desc>The term street football encompasses a number of informal varieties of association football. These informal games do not necessarily utilise the requirements of a formal game of football, such as a large field, field markings, goal apparatus and corner flags, eleven players per team (with a minimum of seven per team), or match officials (referee and assistant referees). Often the most basic of set-ups will involve just a ball with a wall or fence used as a goal, or items such as clothing being used for goalposts (hence the phrase "jumpers for goalposts"). The ease of playing these informal games explains why they are popular all over the world. XS Jr. League Soccer is designed to provide a fun, pick-up-and-play adaptation of the world's most popular sport, with colorful graphics and accessible gameplay for the whole family to enjoy. Select Your Team: 20 individual players. Everybody can really play. Players have different skill levels. 8000 different 5-a-side combos. Schoolyard Tournaments: Put a strong team together; play an entire round robin tournament in one day. 4 Real World Fields: The School Yard, Sandpit, Car Park, Southside.</desc>

		<name>Thunderstrike 2</name>
		<desc>Your name is General John T. Maclaine and you are the pilot of Firestorm 1, the lead dog in special attack missions to various parts of the world. Your helicopter is extremely powerful and carries the following weapons: 30mm Chain Gun, Firestorm Homing Missile, Rocket Pod, Runaway Cratering System (bombs), the Mk-84 500-Pound Bomb, Cluster Bombs, and the Anti-Ship Missile. These weapons -- plus excellent evasive, and attack maneuvers -- should be enough to help you succeed in attacks on drug runners and terrorists, from Columbia to Iraq. Thunder Strike 2 is the sequel to Core's Amiga, ST, PC &amp; Sega CD game, AH-3 Thunderstrike. Like the previous game in the series, this is a helicopter simulator/shooter. It features realistic features like multiple weapons selection, full freedom of movement, and a mission-based structure. On the other hand, it also throws lots and lots of enemy tanks and helicopters at you to blow up. The graphics in Thunderstrike 2 are drawn completely with 3D polygons, including the helicopter's cockpit. As you track an enemy, the view changes so that it is always in your sights. There are 8 campaigns to complete, each with multiple missions. A blistering airborne monster of a game, offering 37 levels of arcade action viewed from the cockpit of a Thunderhawk attack helicopter. Firestorm offers all the thrills and spills of flying without the need to master the complexities of more traditional flight simulations. The speed and attention to detail in the graphics will hit you between the eyes, while a gentle gameplay undercurrent that calls for strategic thinking during missions - as well as for arcade-sharp reflexes - ensures that Firestorm Thunderhawk 2 will present an extended challenge to the most trigger-happy aviator. Clearly a thinking man's shoot-em-up, Firestorm also offers the fun and satisfaction of a flight sim without the learning curve and concentration needed just to stay in the air.</desc>

		<desc>Gubble is a cute, colorful alien and he needs your help to get back to his home in this PlayStation game. It seems that creatures of Gubble's kind are particularly adept at loosening screws, nails, rivets, and other such fasteners. So adept, in fact, that Gubble has been kidnapped and sent to a dangerous planet to ply this skill. His captors have instructed him to unfasten the screws and bolts on a large enemy ship, promising to return him to his home if he is successful. Success will take good puzzle-solving skills though (and perhaps a little luck), as the falling pieces from the unfastened ship could put a quick end to Gubble's efforts. Not to mention the enemy creatures, who would rather their high-tech equipment remain in one piece. Features: * Use a variety of gadgets to help get Gubble home * A dozen challenging levels * Locate the Magic Ring to earn bonus time</desc>

Unlike the first game you can now pick the player yourself, instead of being assigned one, which allows you to make some unconventional choices, such as playing a goal keeper. You play the game from a third person perspective. You can perform typical moves for soccer games, and also have the option to give commands to your teammates, to pass, shoot or intercept. After each match you are presented with statistical graphs and you are graded for your play. Game modes include friendly matches, two tourneys and a league. You can play with or against a friend in split-screen mode. Create-A-Player is in this new update and it does the job perfectly. Edit the height, weight, hair colour, name etc of a default player and then save him into your favourite team. There are 4 modes: - Libero Grande Cup: 32 teams one game per round. - World League: A league with 2 to 8 selections - International Cup: It's the world cup without the license. -Friendly The training challenges mode has gone,</desc>

		<desc>In the time of New Tokyo, a time in which corruption and criminal behavior is at an all time high, a girl named Angela has been kidnapped. Her parents have hired a detective named Travis to investigate a gang run by the notorious crime boss Kintaro; some say the gang is involved with the darker side of life, namely Hell. Knowing how difficult the mission is, the detective will need all the assistance he can get. Joining Travis on his brutal and bloody quest is an old friend named Michelle, a martial arts mentor known as Ushi and his student, Tetsuo. You and up to three friends will control these characters (simultaneously) through Gekido: Urban Fighters -- a side scrolling 3D beat 'em up in the vein of Final Fight and Streets of Rage. Like the aforementioned games, each fighter handles differently; whereas Travis is the well-balanced brawler, Michelle excels in speed but lacks in power. In addition to the four selectable characters, there are two hidden fighters to unlock with extended gameplay.</desc>

		<name>Freestyle Motocross : McGrath vs. Pastrana</name>
		<desc>Freestyle Motocross: McGrath vs. Pastrana not only combines two of the sport's biggest stars, but also the two unique styles of motocross into one game. The game seeks to combine both freestyle and motocross into one event. Players race amongst four other riders, taking on a twisted track with plenty of places to catch air, but they won't just be jockeying for the head of the pack. They'll also have to mix some tricks into their run, because position is not only determined by where you are in the pack, but how stylish and challenging your run is in terms of stunts. There are over 30 tricks in all to keep you occupied. There are ten different tracks for you to challenge in Freestyle Motocross, ranging from predictable locations such as Las Vegas to more exotic locales like Tombstone and Loch Ness. Each track is built to suit both speed and tricks, alternating between straight-aways and bumpy terrain perfect for executing a combo or holding that trick for just a moment longer in order to score bigger points. Of course, if the racing aspect of the game isn't your cup of tea, you can also switch to a plain Freestyle mode where the only goal is to do tricks and score points - perfect for those who like to cut out everything but the basics. You can also choose to play a Single Race or run some Time Trials. And if you get tired of playing by yourself, grab a friend and go head to head in Multiplayer mode. Features: # Racing mode # Freestyle mode # Pull off big tricks # Race on a variety of tracks # Challenge a friend to some action</desc>

		<desc>Incredible Crisis follows the stories of four members of a Japanese family on their grandmother's birthday. As each family member goes through a seemingly normal day, things start to go wrong -- very wrong. Players will be able to live out this family's hair-raising experiences by playing a series of mini-games. At its core, Incredible Crisis is a collection of mini-games strung together in order to advance the plot. Games range from a beatmania-style of timed gameplay (where certain buttons are pressed during certain beats) to shooting down airplanes, attacking UFOs, and even a certain "massage" level that is so analogous to a sexual experience that if gamers only heard the instructions and game mechanics, they would swear they were playing a game rated A for adult.</desc>

In a royal decree, the king beckons for Kid Clown, a hero of past Kemco games, to clean up these bombs in all six continents. The strange, yet brave little clown sets out to blast the bombs away before the planet explodes. Clearing these bombs will not always be easy, as they have been arranged in puzzles across 60 different levels. Kid Clown must act wisely, because each level has only one igniter bomb that can detonate the bombs surrounding it. To successfully complete a level in one try, Kid Clown must arrange the bombs so that a chain reaction takes place.

After centuries of slumber, Dragless is now showing signs of awakening, and it's now up to the 14-years old Daigo Raioh, descendant of the young hero, to defeat the monster once and for all. Meanwhile, other talented fighters will set out, some for reasons related to Dragless (like Terrific Forelock, the bodyguard and childhood friend of Princess Mirona, who's out to save her after she has been kidnapped by the Demon King), others not at all (like Misa Atago, who goes on a trip to ease the pain of her break-up with her boyfriend). In the end, all of them will learn about Dragless and realize how serious the situation is.</desc>

		<desc>Gran Turismo is fundamentally based on the racing simulator genre. The player must maneuver an automobile to compete against artificially intelligent drivers on various race tracks. The game uses two different modes: Arcade Mode and Simulation Mode (Gran Turismo Mode in PAL and Japanese versions). In the arcade mode, the player can freely choose the courses and vehicles they wish to use. Winning races unlocks additional cars and courses. However, simulation mode requires the player to earn different levels of driver's licenses in order to qualify for events, and earn credits(money), trophies and prize cars by winning race championships. Winning one particular championship also unlocks a video and a few additional demonstration tracks. Money earned by winning championships can be used to purchase additional vehicles, and for parts and tuning of all vehicles. Gran Turismo features 180 cars and 11 race tracks (as well as reversed versions). Two Honda del Sol cars from 1995 were included in the Japanese version, but were removed from the North American and European versions. They can be found in the North American version's code (and are unlockable via a GameShark cheat device). In addition to the hidden del Sols, there is also a 1967 Chevrolet Corvette and a 1998 Mazda Roadster exclusive to Arcade mode. The Corvette and Roadster can also be accessed via GameShark.</desc>

		<name>Wild Rapids</name>
		<desc>Kayaking is the use of a kayak for moving across water. Kayaking and canoeing are also known as paddling. Kayaking is distinguished from canoeing by the sitting position of the paddler and the number of blades on the paddle. A kayak is defined by the International Canoe Federation (the world sanctioning body) as a boat where the paddler faces forward, legs in front, using a double-bladed paddle. Most kayaks have closed decks, although "sit-on-top" kayaks are growing in popularity, as are inflatable kayaks which come without decks but which have air chambers surrounding the boat. Wild Rapids is the first ever PlayStation game to deliver the adrenaline hit that is white water kayaking. An out and out arcade game rather than a kayaking sim, Wild Rapids nonetheless delivers a realistic physics model giving just the right balance between player control and being buffeted by the water.</desc>

So begins this adventure of a hip skunk and his 30 levels of platforming action, taking him through the sky, across land, underneath the ground and over water. Multiple paths and bonus levels will offer some variety in this throwback to 2D platform games of the past. In order to succeed, Punky must use various moves to fight enemies, avoid traps and find the flagpole signifying the end of the level. In addition, you'll be able to collect stars and 1-ups for extra lives, green orbs to replenish health, and gear icons outfitting Punky with one of six pieces of equipment: Paraglider, Inline Skates, Skysurfer, Pogo Stick, Jetpack or Diggers. Besides using the gear, Punky can either jump or attack enemies with his "spray." Skunk got you stumped? Not to worry, you can resume progress at the start of each cleared stage if you have a memory card. Characters: - PUNKY (Kuri in Japanese): The hero of our game a skunk. He's had it with Badler, and he's going to fight back. - KELLY: A red bunny, She gives Punky advice as the game advances. - NASH: A badger gadgeteer, who for some unexplained reason always wears a flight helmet. - BADLER: The wolf who is threatening Punky's island with his massive amusement park.</desc>

But the monsters in the tower lay eggs, and whoever takes possession of such an egg, can tame a monster which will come out of it, and those monsters, called "familiars", will help their tamers in times of danger. Some brave adventurers dared to enter the tower and to take the eggs. One of them was called Guy. He was killed in the monster tower. Now his son Koh is fifteen, and he is allowed to try his luck in the tower. You control Koh and his party of "familiars" in this unusual "monster-taming" RPG. You must capture the eggs from the tower, bring them home, grow monsters and tame them. During battles, you assign different commands to them. Different species have different abilities and need different approach. The battles system is a mixture of real time and turn based combat. Unlike most other console RPGs, there are no special battle screens.</desc>

		<desc>Tetris Plus is a puzzle video game developed by Natsume and published by Jaleco for arcades exclusively in Japan in 1996, and was ported to the Game Boy, Sega Saturn, and PlayStation later that year. The game would be followed by a sequel, Tetris Plus 2, in 1997. GAMEPLAY: The game consists of two main modes, Classic Mode and Puzzle Mode. Classic Mode functions like the original Tetris game for the Game Boy except with different music and visuals. However, because the cartridge has battery-powered SRAM, it also has the ability to remember your high-scores, unlike the original Game Boy game. Puzzle Mode is a twist on the classic gameplay that provides a new scenario. Also included is an editor for making Puzzle levels, and Link capability for going head-to-head with another player in either game mode. The Console Versions also have a two player Versus Mode which is essentially puzzle mode with two players racing for the finish line. PUZZLE MODE: The biggest addition to Tetris Plus is the Puzzle Mode. The player starts by choosing any of four world locations: Maya, Knossos, Egypt, or Angkor Wat. The final area, Atlantis, is unlocked by successfully completing the other four stages (in any order). Each of the four locations has a different level set. Once the game starts, the player is presented with a cluster of pre-placed bricks, and the professor enters the play-area through a disappearing gate. The objective is to get the professor to the bottom of the screen, by placing blocks and clearing lines, before the spiked ceiling at the top comes down and crushes him. The player's goal is to guide this archaeologist to the bottom as fast as possible. Two blocks wide and tall, he will aimlessly walk forward until he bumps into a block, after which he turns around and walks the other way. If he comes across a gap that is large enough for him to fit through, he will fall down onto the blocks below him. Conversely, if blocks are placed on top of him, he will climb up them until he reaches the top. As one could guess, if these blocks lead too closely to the spikes, the professor will die. Upon starting the level, the spiked ceiling will start at the top of the play-area. About once every eighteen seconds, it will move down one row, slowly taking away workable space. The player is able to make the ceiling go back up, however, if they can clear three or four rows at once. The ceiling will also destroy any placed blocks that are in its way. This can be used as a garbage disposal, by having it remove any unwanted pieces until the piece the player wants shows up.</desc>

		<name>The Amazing Virtual Sea-Monkeys</name>
		<desc>Initially released for the PC in 2001, The Amazing Virtual Sea-Monkeys float their way to the PlayStation in a life-development simulation set in a sprawling 70 levels of undersea environments. Players are challenged to lead the newly hatched sea-monkeys to the safety of the Venus Shell, but must do so without any direct control over them. Instead, players control Nautila, the sea-monkey's protector and guide, who is a 358-year old fish that uses her multi-purpose long nose for various actions. Predators, traps, plants, and objects stand in the way of getting her charges to safety, but Nautila can use some underwater creatures to help control the frisky sea-monkeys. Ollie the Octopus, goldfish, blowfish, jellyfish, lantern fish, dogfish, and more can all be harmful in some ways to the sea-monkeys, but their characteristics can also be harnessed by Nautila to good advantage. Other gameplay elements include using bubbles to either protect sea-monkeys or imprison their enemies, collecting a certain number of goldfish to clear levels, and the requirement to rescue a specific number of sea-monkeys within pre-set time limits per level.</desc>

A dozen years later, NASA's analysis is complete and the existence of alien microfossils confirmed. In 2009, a manned mission to Mars to investigate bacterial life is launched with the establishment of the Vita 1 base the result. And now, in 2018, all communication with the base has been terminated. Vita 1's last message is the enigmatic: "If you send a manned craft, warn the crew to stay alone, stay alive." Nearly a year later, a team sent to investigate survives a crash on the Martian surface and arrives at the derelict base. Following the advice of the last message from Vita 1, each member enters the base through a separate airlock.</desc>

		<name>Zeiramzone</name>
		<desc>Zeiramzone is a game based on the anime Iria: Zeiram the Animation that is a six episode OVA series featuring Iria, a female bounty hunter. The series serves as a prequel to the original live-action film Zeiram, taking place several years earlier when Iria is still a rookie and detailing the events surrounding her first encounter with the unstoppable Zeiram. The story begins with Iria as an apprentice to her older brother, Gren, a veteran bounty hunter, and his partner Bob, who work for Ghomvak Security along with a somewhat loutish hunter named Fujikuro. During a rescue mission to a hi-jacked spaceship called the Karma, they discover that the hi-jacker is actually a seemingly indestructible alien called Zeiram that broke out of the cargo hold during transit and began to massacre the crew. Bob is critically wounded by Zeiram while evacuating the survivors, and Gren is lost while attempting to kill Zeiram by destroying the Karma. Returning to Myce, Iria finds herself targeted by assassins working for Tedan Tippedai, the corporation that owned the Karma, and discovers a covered-up plot to control Zeiram in order to use it as a weapon. Iria escapes with the help of Fujikuro and reunites with Bob, who never recovered from his injuries but had his mind downloaded into a computer program. Together they continue to investigate rumours that Zeiram has appeared on Myce, and try to find out what happened to Gren, who also seems to have survived the Karma's destruction... In the game the player takes the role of the bounty huntress from Myce named Iria. The gameplay is a classic beat'em up in which the player advance through different levels defeating all the enemies on each level.</desc>

		<desc>Adam Crowley, a once-respected scientist, now turned to black magic, has released a demonic contagion onto the streets of 1834 London. Based on the long-lost work of the Brotherhood of Hecate, it mutates its victim's bodies into grotesque nightmare creatures, and changes their minds into those of murderous brutes. When Dr. Jean F. began investigating, he was murdered. Now, as either his friend Ignatius Blackward, a priest and expert on the occult, or his daughter Nadia, a biologist and gymnast, fight against the creatures that roam the streets of London, the revived Brotherhood of Hectate, and the man behind it all, Adam Crowley. Gameplay is 3rd-person action, with an emphasis on melee combat. Ignatius and Nadia have different fighting styles and special moves. To keep things moving, an adrenaline meter depletes, killing the hero if it ever runs out. Kill monsters to top it up again. Gather special items to use on enemies, or just kill them using basic weapons.</desc>

Developed by Namco and previously released in the Arcade, Time Crisis is a first-person on-rails light gun shooter; there are two versions -- one with the Guncon peripheral and one without. Using either control method, you'll blast your way through three stages, each with four areas filled with hired goons and vile boss characters. When the action stage begins, you'll start from a crouched position while enemy troops try and thwart your objective. While they're reloading, stand up and start spraying the area. You will have the option of crouching behind objects at anytime during gunfights. Just remember to keep your gun reloaded!</desc>

Scientists believed human life could exist on the planet, which was great news to everyone because the Earth was slowly running out of natural resources. If it was ever needed, the government could set up shop on the surface of Mars and transport humans to live in colonies or bring back valuable resources to Earth. By the year 2034, Earth has finally run out of resources and machines have been set to Mars in an attempt to mine it. The machines were given synthetic brains with simple artificial intelligence and without any defensive mechanisms or assault weaponry. This proved to be very costly to the human race, since aliens have landed on the planet and are taking over the robots.</desc>

		<name>Porsche Challenge</name>
		<desc>Porsche Challenge is the first release from the European division at Sony Computer Entertainment. Based on the Porsche Boxster, fans can test drive as well as race one of Porsche's most spectacular looking vehicles to date. So strap yourself in as you prepare to put the pedal to the metal when you push one of the most powerful sport machines to its limits on test tracks set right across the globe. The Porsche Boxster is a machine capable of going from zero to 60 mph in a mere 6.7 seconds, powered by a six-cylinder, 24-valve twin overhead camshaft. With 201 horse power at 6,000 rpm and 181 pound-per-foot of torque at 4,500 rpm, the Boxster is well known for its amazing power and top speed at 200 km per hour. Sony Computer Entertainment Europe has been able to create the 3D model by blueprints of the vehicle from Porsche engineers and have created the car all the way up from gouraud shading and real-time lighting effects for maximum realism and effect. The View Boxster option allows players to watch a documentary film on the Porsche's and Boxster's creation with the history told from the viewpoint of the engineers themselves. Sony Computer Entertainment Europe has also created four test grounds for testing and racing the Boxster. These include U.S.A., Japan, Alpine, and Stuttgart, the official testing track for Porsche vehicles. These tracks have been further opened up to create a total of 20 track combinations through the use of opening up new paths, and racing the tracks in reverse. The single-player side of Porsche Challenge is split into Practice, Time Trial, and Championship modes. Championship provides a collection of 12 races with five other competitors per race, as well as being available through three different difficulties. The two-player option allows players to play either Single Race or Championship modes with the options to play Arcade or Simulation style where they can switch on or off, catch up, and choose one- or two-player delay. Players can also select what driver they want to use with each sporting a different color Boxster, as well as a racing personality. Options in Porsche Challenge include a CD player that allows: alignment of the four provided electronic tracks with each course (tracks include "Asian Beats," "Alpine Funk," and "Tribute to Dragon"), output effects, change music and sound effects volume, high scores, button configuration, and automatic and manual selections. English, French, and Italian languages are also offered. As well, the game supports analog control and uses only one block of memory.</desc>

The game is seem from a third-person perspective behind the ship. Some areas place you outside and some inside, but the majority of the game takes place rotating around tubes.

You can obtain different power-ups including special weapons, health bonuses and extra lives as you play through the game?s 9 levels.

		<desc>Marvel Comics' stars Iron Man and X-O Manowar have teamed up to save the world from their ruthless enemies. Choose either character and get ready to blast through eight levels spanning multiple zones: Nuclear Plant, Stark Enterprises, New York City, Rain Forest, Isle, Drill Platform, Dromak Ship and Cyberspace. Each area is filled with troops such as Spider Alien Soldiers (armed with laser blasters) and various defenses including laser turrets, cannons and electrical traps. Luckily, both characters have a few moves at their disposal to combat these threats. Iron Man and X-O Manowar can fire short blasts of energy from their arms, hover in the air, punch and kick, fire chest weapons, and pick up and throw objects. Since enemies will appear in both the foreground and background, you can also fire weapons on either plane! Various power-ups include first-aid kits to replenish each character's armor, one-up icons to add to their number of lives, and continue icons to let players resume progress after dying. The game also features several boss characters at the conclusion of each zone, such as Goliath, Yellowjacket, Titania, Mr. Hyde and many more. Bring along a second player for simultaneous action!</desc>

		<name>Super Shot Soccer</name>
		<desc>Tecmo's Super Shot Soccer is a hybrid of simulation and arcade-styled soccer. Featuring over 30 teams from around the world, the game's play modes are based on international-styled soccer. The four play modes are Test Mode (exhibition play), World Tournament Play (inspired by soccer's World Cup), International League (a round-robin league) and International Cup (a 16 team tournament). Of these modes, only Test Mode allows two players to play the game at the same time. Differing itself from typical soccer simulation titles, Super Shot Soccer provides over the top arcade-style plays. Called Super Shot Special Moves, each team has two or three special moves that tie into the team's nationality. These provide a unique twist to simulation soccer, as gameplay can be interrupted by national monuments, disaster attacks and more. Special moves can be used to affect both offensive and defensive strategies.</desc>

		<desc>Take the law into your own hands. This game takes place in the Western United States during a time of world-wide oil shortage in 1976. OMAR (Oil Monopoly Alliance Regime) was making money off the shortage, except in the U.S. OMAR hires the best terrorist that $100 million could buy: Sid Burn. His job, aided by 5 hired Coyotes, is to destroy all gas refineries in the southwest of the U.S. so OMAR can bring the U.S. to its knees. Then later, when gas prices went wild, 6 civilians by the name of Vigilantes, lead by the truck driver Convoy, fight against the Coyotes in different areas to keep OMAR from succeeding. Choose from 8 characters with different endings with cars ranging to classic 70's muscle cars to a school bus, each stacked high with all sorts of weapons. Lots of unlockables include 2 hidden levels (3 hidden levels in the N64 version) and 5 hidden characters and cars. Multiplayer, of course, is where it's at. The PSX version allows 2 players, while the N64 title allows 4 to go head-to-head.</desc>

		<name>LEGO Island 2 : The Brickster's Revenge</name>
		<desc>As a follow-up to the first LEGO Island PC title, LEGO Island 2: The Brickster's Revenge features Pepper Roni, a pizza delivery boy that players control, trying to save LEGO Island from the evil Brickster. The Brickster has dismantled the Infomaniac's building instruction book, known as the Constructopedia, and only Pepper can find the pages. Meanwhile, as if The Brickster and the havoc he wreaks aren't bad enough, Pepper has to keep his day job delivering pizzas. While exploring LEGO Island, clues and information must be obtained from the inhabitants. Playing as Pepper, gamers skateboard, walk, or otherwise transport themselves around the island, talking to people, solving puzzles, and playing a variety of sub-games. Bull fighting, jousting, driving, and flying are just some of the activities included in the sub-games. After winning enough mini-games and successfully navigating all areas, Pepper will be faced with the challenge to defeat The Brickster in one last game. If Pepper can avoid the falling bricks while clearing a path to The Brickster, he can throw pizzas that will splat the villain into submission. Other features and areas of the game include an inventory screen, Pepper's house (built with bricks he acquires during play), and additional pickup items for later use. Constructopedia pages must be collected in their entirety; gems and goblets increase scores, and medals can be earned based upon performances in sub-games.</desc>

		<desc>Point Blank is a light gun arcade game, in which players shoots targets in a wide variety of stages. The Playstation version uses the G-Con gun, for action similar to Time Crisis, also by Namco. The game has a distinct cartoon theme and is non-violent, making it suitable for all ages. Each stage has a different objective, explained at the start of each stage. This varies from simple target shooting (and avoid to shoot bomb), shooting cardboard villains (avoid shooting cardboard civilians), shooting own color targets (avoid shooting opposing players color), protecting the iconic Dr.Don and Dr. Dan, and many miscellaneous challenges such as the Galaxian stage where lightgun is used in place of spaceships to shoot aliens. The stages are presented in groups of 4 and the player or players can choose in which order to play them. You lose a life-heart when you shoot an incorrect target or bomb, or when you fail to complete a mission within the time limit. As well as converting the arcade game in its entirety, this conversion also offers a new Quest mode, a Party Play system and more.</desc>

It debuted as a tokusatsu television series on April 3, 1971 and ran until February 10, 1973, airing on the Mainichi Broadcasting System and NET TV (now TV Asahi). A manga adaptation was also featured in Shonen Magazine around the same period. Although each entry in the series is different, each one shares similar traits with one and another. All generally involve at least one young adult male transforming into a Kamen Rider to fight various monsters and organizations linked to that specific Kamen Rider's origin. As the series progresses, the Rider often learns more about the monsters in the series, other Kamen Riders or the origin of his powers. Early Kamen Riders were generally based on grasshoppers, but this practice has only been done twice in the newer set of shows.</desc>

An unblockable fireball attack has been added in this installment. The Quest Mode has undergone a significant expansion, including role-playing elements. In addition to the dungeons featured in the first game, the sequel adds an explorable town, where the main character can eat, rest, and buy supplies. An experience system has also been added. Consuming food and potions will have an effect on the character's attack and defense power. Individual attacks and body parts can be increased in strength as well. Also new in the Quest Mode is the ability to capture encountered monsters and then use them as playable characters in the Vs. mode. The amount of playable characters in this fighting game can be therefore as high as two hundred.</desc>

The main objective is to decode the secret of the Castle of the Order of Tunguska, where he finds himself after he's accidentally caught by the 'powers of darkness'. In this complex thriller you play Jack, a young man who has escaped from the clutches of a suicidal cult. Except for Jack, all of the members of the cult have perished in a hideous fire. Unfortunately, because of this Jack is accused and convicted of mass murder and sentenced to death. Suddenly, just as he is strapped into the electric chair, Jack is transported into another world -- one much worse than even his own. Death cults, psychopathic monks, being framed for murder; this was only the beginning. Jack now must escape from the terrors of his nightmare, find the real killer, and get back to this world by means of puzzle solving, combat, and a search for obscure but fascinating objects. PLOT: Tunguska is a story of inter-dimensional travel and a struggle whose outcome will effect us all. At the centre of it all is Jack Riley. An innocent party (aren't we all!) who finds himself caught up in the battle that could allow the powers of darkness to rule our earth. Only decoding the secret of the castle of the Order of Tunguska will ensure our survival. Facing cruel creatures of the night is only part of the struggle as Riley comes to terms with the side of his inner self he'd rather forget. GAMEPLAY: The game involves tactical real-time fighting, in which you advance by a skill/level based system, as well as a limited amount of classic adventure gaming and puzzle-solving. When you decode the secret of the Castle, the powers of darkness will be defeated and Jack is free to continue his journey. The 3D rendered world is based on Exortus' self-developed game engine, and the view is 3-dimensional in non-isometric, third-person.</desc>

The game starts out simple enough with the evil Koma Pigs stealing Tomba's bracelet, which was given to him by his grandfather. You assume the role of Tomba and begin your adventure. Little do you know that the quest for your bracelet will turn into so much more. Because of its role-playing elements, in Tomba!, your character will gain experience points, develop new skills and learn new things. He has seven abilities that can be learned throughout the duration of the game. Once all three experience meters reach level ten (in order to do this, Tomba must do certain things), he will unlock and learn an ability.</desc>

		<desc>Squash is a racquet sport played by two players in a four-walled court with a small, hollow rubber ball. Squash is recognized by the IOC and remains in contention for incorporation in a future Olympic program. The game was formerly called squash racquets, a reference to the "squashable" soft ball used in the game (compared with the fatter ball used in its parent game racquets. Street Racquetball is one of very few console games featuring the enclosed sport of racquetball, though the first title devoted to the sport, Racquetball, was released in 1981 for the Atari Video Computer System. A1 Games' history of released sports related games includes tennis, boxing, bowling, kickboxing, snowboarding, racing and more. As in indoor racquetball courts, Street Racquetball's "outdoor" courts contain two sidewalls, a front wall, serving zones, and a receiving line -- but no ceiling. Players can opt for exhibition mode (against the computer), challenge mode (unlock new characters and courts by winning three consecutive matches), training mode (continuous rally solo play), or two-player VS mode. Three difficulty settings offer "easy," "normal." or "hard" gameplay, ball bounce levels can be adjusted to "low," "middle," or "high," and the eight computer-controlled opponents are rated in performance level, type of game, power, speed, and skill. Shots include slams, lobs, and drop shots. Features Unlock up to eight computer-controlled players with individual strengths and weaknesses Four gameplay modes include exhibition, challenge, training or two-player VS Three difficulty settings and adjustable ball bounce properties</desc>

So begins this adventure of a hip skunk and his 30 levels of platforming action, taking him through the sky, across land, underneath the ground and over water. Multiple paths and bonus levels will offer some variety in this throwback to 2D platform games of the past. In order to succeed, Punky must use various moves to fight enemies, avoid traps and find the flagpole signifying the end of the level. In addition, you'll be able to collect stars and 1-ups for extra lives, green orbs to replenish health, and gear icons outfitting Punky with one of six pieces of equipment: Paraglider, Inline Skates, Skysurfer, Pogo Stick, Jetpack or Diggers. Besides using the gear, Punky can either jump or attack enemies with his "spray." Skunk got you stumped? Not to worry, you can resume progress at the start of each cleared stage if you have a memory card. Characters: - PUNKY (Kuri in Japanese): The hero of our game a skunk. He's had it with Badler, and he's going to fight back. - KELLY: A red bunny, She gives Punky advice as the game advances. - NASH: A badger gadgeteer, who for some unexplained reason always wears a flight helmet. - BADLER: The wolf who is threatening Punky's island with his massive amusement park.</desc>

Cotton games have appeared on a variety of consoles including the NEC PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16, the Super Nintendo, the Mega Drive/Sega Genesis, the Sega Saturn, the PlayStation, the Neo Geo Pocket Color, and the Dreamcast.

Colored gems fall from the top of the screen in pairs, but this time lining up those of the same color is not enough. To break the gems and punish your opponent with counter gems you have to place a crash gem of the same color next to the gems. If you make a block of gems of the same color they'll fuse, forming a power gem. Breaking a power gem sends more counter gems to your opponent than breaking the same amount of gems in some other configuration. But the ultimate attack is breaking power gems in chain.</desc>

		<desc>Street Fighter: The Movie is a 2D beat 'em up game based on the movie of the same name, which in turn is based on the well known Capcom series, Street Fighter. Using digitized animation based on the actors and the many locations featured in the film, the same style of gameplay found in Street Fighter II and Super Street Fighter II Turbo is used here. Select from a range of fighters (including Ryu, Ken, Guile, M. Bison and Chun Li) each with their own set of special moves, and defeat all of the opposition to become the King of Street Fighting. Also included is a story mode which follows the story of the movie and uses FMV in-between fights and a Trial Battle Mode, where you take on Guile in a range of different battle events to test your skills.</desc>

		<name>Felony 11-79</name>
		<desc>In Felony 11-79 the player is a thief hired by an eccentric millionaire that wants them to acquire an ancient statue that has been broken into three pieces and scattered throughout the city. To obtain these pieces, the player must travel through these three areas (Downtown, Seaside, and Metro City) and complete certain objectives by obtaining certain items to complete missions or escaping police in high-speed chases all within a certain time limit. Additionally, the player is also awarded monetarily for destroying other cars, objects such as lamp posts, fences, etc, however money is deducted for hitting pedestrians. This money is used to customize the vehicles (20 total). Players must also be aware of the destruction they do to their vehicle, if it is too damaged they will no longer be able to complete the mission and end the game. There are also two other modes that are present, one of which is Time Trial where a player races against the clock and attempt to beat record time limits by any means including finding shortcuts. There is also Test Run which lets a player get the feel of a car without the boundaries of set objectives or a time limit.</desc>

		<path>./Tiny Tank.chd</path>
		<name>Tiny Tank</name>
		<desc>In a future world, an army of steel robots are out to destroy the human race. Our only hope is a little yellow tank armed with some mighty big guns. The sentient Tiny Tank was originally created to appease a public that feared the mindless violence waged by larger war-robots, but he was soon destroyed by one of those jealous automatons at the beginning of the robot revolution 100 years ago. Almost destroyed, at least. Thanks to nano-technology, hundreds of microscopic "Fix-It Crabs" went to work and Tiny Tank was slowly rebuilt. Now he alone stands against the threat of the cruel MuTank and his deadly robot minions, who have all but erased human civilization from the planet's surface. The spunky little tank will need luck, strategy, and all the futuristic firepower he can get his treads on to save the human race. STORY: Sometime before 2094 A.D., all of Earth's armed forces were disintegrated into one large corporation, SenTrax. SenTrax vowed to create a robot army to fight humanity's wars, so mankind itself would not have to. However, they needed the peoples' vote to set this plan into motion, and thus developed the titular "Tiny Tank" - a small yellow tank with an occasionally unfriendly attitude. The creation of this cute killing machine made SenTrax's popularity skyrocket, and won them the vote. As thanks, the corporation set up an exhibition showing their yellow mascot fighting off the entire SenTrax army on July 4, 2094, broadcast live over the Internet. However, once the event began, one of the SenTrax robots had been accidentally fitted with live ammunition and destroyed Tiny with one shot. As a result, Tiny's "positronic brain" (his artificial intelligence system) shattered, and its shards gave "life" to the entire robot army. The robot that had fired the shot, now self-aware and calling himself Mutank, took control of the rampant robots and began to eliminate humanity so that machines could thrive. Humanity was forced to evacuate into underground asteroid shelters as the mechanical army conquered the surface. On July 4, 2194 A.D., exactly 100 years later, Tiny Tank was finally rebuilt thanks to automated SenTrax Fix-It Crabs, which were minuscule robots made to repair broken machinery. A female artificial intelligence on board an orbital satellite reawakened Tiny, and sent him to fight Mutank's robot army and save mankind. GAMEPLAY: Tiny Tank is a relatively straightforward third person shooter. The player controls Tiny as he traverses many levels, eliminating SenTrax forces as he goes. There are two bars at the top of the screen that show Tiny's health and the amount of nanometal acquired. Nanometal is essential for the on-board Fix-It Crabs to repair Tiny. If the nanometal meter runs out, health cannot be regenerated. There is also a map on the upper right hand corner identifying the surroundings, enemies, and mission objectives.Tiny canalso pick up fallen parts from destroyed enemie. Features: Free-roaming warfare across 3D battlefields Command "Teeny Weeny" tanks to scout ahead or retrieve weapons Analog Control and Vibration Function compatible Two-player Death Match mode</desc>

Instead, there is an introduction movie showing a completely flat (2D) lemming popping out of a computer's floppy drive, and finding a "3D" button to press, which makes him 3-dimensional. After that, the PC blows up and the (now 3D) lemmings inside it escape.</desc>

Uma de suas colegas busca pará-lo, mas ela é velha demais para fazer isso por conta próprio. Dessa forma, ela ordena que suas duas filhas preguiçosas salvem o dia, equipando-as com uma espécie de motocicleta voadora armada até os dentes com estranhas armas.</desc>

Fighter Maker features a complete 3D character posing system -- think of it as a simplified version of Kinetix's Character Studio R2 for 3D Studio MAX.

		<name>Tomb Raider III : Adventures of Lara Croft</name>
		<desc>The amazing adventurer Lara Croft returns once again with the third release in the Tomb Raider series for the PlayStation, Tomb Raider III: The Adventures of Lara Croft. This time she has some new moves such as crawl, monkey swing, and speed dash to help her through tough situations. The story unfolds with some background on the current situation. In years past, British sailors discovered a meteor buried deep in the Earth. Unwittingly, they looted four artifacts found with the meteor. One of these sailors kept a journal as they headed back to England -- he was the only one to make it home alive. With that in mind, the game begins with several key elements falling into place that will eventually reunite the lost artifacts. Lara is in India searching for one of these precious items, unaware of its true history. She only knows that local beliefs state that the artifact was to contain great powers. It is up to you as Lara to use what little information you have at hand to begin your quest in finding the artifacts, and discovering their power. Tomb Raider III's graphics have been updated from the previous titles with a faster engine. Such improvements include more texture palettes for finer detail, improved water and reflection effects, smoother surfaces and real-time lighting effects. The story and gameplay are designed to unfold in a non-linear fashion, as in Lara's previous adventures, but even more so. This time gamers will be able to choose their own destiny by selecting the order in which they play each of the four main levels. The levels are also more open, with multiple routes to the same end. You may also choose to replay each level so you can avoid missing any part of the adventure.</desc>

Com o passar dos anos, Selene se torna maior, mais poderosa e mais independente da Terra - até o ponto em que a Lua e a Terra lutam em uma guerra que termina sem uma vitória definitiva para nenhum dos lados. Em 2242, a guerra irrompe novamente - a Terra lentamente começa a ganhar ... exceto pelos esforços de uma tecnologia experimental Selene conhecida como Einhänders: máquinas voadoras com uma "mão" que lhes permite mudar de armamento no meio da batalha. Em 12 de dezembro de 2245, Selene envia 3 Einhänders em uma última tentativa de virar a maré da guerra. Você pode escolher a nave para pilotar, e cabe a você lutar contra as monstruosas defesas da Terra e vencer a batalha. O jogo é um shooter de tela lateral, com fundos 3D renderizados e inimigos. A atmosfera do jogo é muito "industrial", até a música industrial alemã tocando ao fundo. A troca de armas e a reivindicação são parte integrante do jogo, já que as armas têm tiros limitados.</desc>

		<name>Tatsunoko Fight</name>
		<desc>Tatsunoko Fight is a fighting video game developed and published by Takara for the PlayStation game console released in Japan in October 2000. It features characters from various Tatsunoko superhero properties in addition to original creations developed exclusively for the game. Each series is represented by characters, backgrounds, music, and voice actors from the original television programs, along with new art and animated sequences produced by Tatsunoko Production. Tatsunoko Fight is a two-dimensional, one-on-one fighting game where players must defeat their opponent in two of three rounds in order to advance.The game relies on using both normal and special attacks in order to damage the opponent, with a round ending once all of a character's remaining vitality has been lost. A special gauge at the bottom of the screen steadily fills when a character deals or receives damage, reaching a maximum of three levels. Player's can then expend one level at a time to unleash a more powerful super attack on their opponent to deal more damage. The game uses a combo system where light and heavy attacks can be chained together to launch a succession of attacks that cannot be interrupted or stopped until the sequence ends. In addition to normal versus mode, players may choose a round-robin-style team battle mode involving multiple characters, as well as a single-player story mode that resembles an arcade fighting game. Tatsunoko Fight features playable characters from four established Tatsunoko franchises: Science Ninja Team Gatchaman, Neo-Human Casshern, Tekkaman: The Space Knight, and Hurricane Polymar, as well an original series created exclusively for the game, Denkou Senka Volter. Each series is represented by three members, consisting of a "Hero", "Supporter", and "Arch Rival" character from their respective titles. Many of the game's characters are voiced by the actors who portrayed them in their original animated appearances, with additional supporting characters making cameo appearances throughout gameplay.</desc>

		<name>Sorcerer's Maze</name>
		<desc>As in the classic arcade title Breakout, Sorcerer's Maze presents players with a series of increasingly difficult stages, each of which must be cleared by destroying a variety of colored bricks found within. Players are equipped with a small paddle, capable only of horizontal movement, which they maneuver so as to deflect a tiny ball around the screen -- the ball will destroy any brick it contacts, while continuing to ricochet. Failing to keep the ball in play will result in the loss of a life -- lose three and the game is over. Destroying certain bricks will result in power-ups being dropped into play, which will alter such variables as the size of the paddle and the number of balls onscreen at any one time, to name but two. Power-ups can also be purchased between stages in order to better equip oneself for precarious situations that may lie ahead. The game comprises more than 100 stages in all, with every ten stages grouped into a "world" based upon a specific theme. At the conclusion of each world, players will face off against a boss creature that must be dispatched in order to continue. Sorcerer's Maze supports both two-player cooperative and competitive play, the former allowing two players to assist each other in clearing each stage, and the latter involving a race to see which player can clear the stage first.</desc>

Taking place in the Crystal Kingdom, a well-natured wizard was mixing a new potion and got some rather explosive results. After a large eruption rocked the castle, his magical gloves flew from his hands and he was instantly turned to stone. As a result of the experiment gone awry, seven power crystals that hold the kingdom in balance were dispersed throughout the land. Assuming the role of the animate glove, you'll go through exotic and complex worlds to locate the seven crystals that have taken on a rubber ball form. Glover's objective is to guide the crystals to safety by maneuvering them throughout the various worlds. It won't be easy however -- the Evil Glove is waiting in the wings to thwart the noble glove's attempt to bring peace and happiness back into the Crystal Kingdom.</desc>

Linking three bubbles together will pop them (remove them from the field), and if there is a stack of six, the bubbles on the way will form a new stack in front of it.

		<name>Qix Neo</name>
		<desc>QIX Neo is a remake of Volfied, Taito's arcade game from 1989. The graphics and sounds were upgraded, but the basic gameplay remains the same, with the player controlling a tiny ship moving over a green contour line. The thin line is drawn over the edges of the screen, framing the game field. The ship acts as a cursor and has to be used to draw a square or rectangular extension into the field, thus removing it and slowly decreasing the size of the available space. Enemies roam each level, moving in random patterns around the screen but always following the movements of the cursor. The ship has a force-field shield around it, and only becomes vulnerable when drawing new lines. The player has to quickly close the sections, timing it correctly to avoid collision with any of the foes or their projectiles. The enemies can be eliminated by connecting a section where they are standing, or by using one of the power-ups. The power-ups are stored inside boxes, that in some levels keep appearing and disappearing, and can be collected by removing a section with one of them inside. Most of the powers are temporary, giving lasers to destroy the smaller aliens, freezing the enemies for a few seconds, increasing the speed of the ship and helping in other ways. Each level is finished after removing at least 70% of the field, or if the large boss monster that shoots at random intervals is killed in some way. A port of the original game is also included, using the old assets but with a horizontal orientation.</desc>

Few would dare to brave its unstable and searing environments - only those determined to grab a little of its remaining gold. You are one of those, taking your hover-bike into disintegrating caverns for a few hours of dangerous work which, successful or not, will be your last. Forsaken is a first-person shoot 'em up in which you have complete movement freedom in 3 dimensions, as you accelerate, swerve and strafe your craft, making for gameplay resembling Descent. Each level has a defined exit which must be reached within a tight time limit. The surrounding areas are collapsing around you, with spikes and turbine fans among your hazards. Be very aware of other craft out to take all you have, as they alter their approach based on your weaponry (from the 25 featured in the game) and past encounters. On the PC, multiplayer action can feature up to 12 human players. The Nintendo 64 version featured 4 player split-screen multiplayer, while the Playstation version has no multiplayer options.</desc>

		<desc>Fresh off the slopes comes Capcom's Trick'N Snowboarder exclusively for the PlayStation. It features a wide variety of distinctive and realistically designed courses ranging from two different half-pipes and a snowboard park to Alpine courses and a large jump ramp specifically used for stunts and tricks. There are also a few hidden goodies/tracks waiting to be unlocked! In addition to the various tracks, there are a few different gameplay options including the Scenario, Versus, Edit, and Free modes. The Scenario mode has the player assuming the role of an up and coming snowboarding star. After joining the Extreme Tour, he sets off an adventure of fame and fortune; players travel around the world competing in various tournaments while gathering material for a snowboarding video. Winning competitions and getting good footage will depend on the player's ability to perform exciting stunts and tricks. Everything found in the actual sport of snowboarding has been included; players are able to execute 360s, grab, and flip their snowboard. Don't confine yourself to just one aerial maneuver -- mix them up and keep the stunts interesting! When players aren't filming their movie and trying to get extraordinary stunts on film, other challenges await. The Versus mode pits two players in a heated one-on-one battle for ultimate snowboarding supremacy. Played from either a horizontal or split screen viewpoint, the object is to either get more points than your friend or finish a course in the quickest amount of time. For the creative types, Capcom included an Edit mode in which players may customize any given snowboarder. Don't like the clothing and/or color scheme? Change them! Think that character would look better with a different brand of snowboard? Roll with it -- it's up to you and your imagination! The customized snowboarder can then be used in any of the gameplay options including a Free mode in which players are given absolute freedom to practice courses and/or tricks. Trick'N Snowboarder supports the Dual Shock Analog Controller by incorporating both analog control and the vibration function into gameplay. Players may also utilize a Memory Card for saving data, Scenario mode progression and customized snowboarders.</desc>

		<desc>Alien monsters and other gigantic nightmares threaten earth. Fortunately for us a special force has been assigned to deal with them which includes the mighty Gamera as an ally. The game puts you in the shoes of Jack, the star pilot behind the jet fighter designed to take out these nasties. Together with Dr. Mikanuki you take to the skies as swarms of monsters attack you mercilessly through several stages. Gameplay-wise Gamera 2000 plays like Panzer Dragoon, as you don't have direct control of your jet, but instead try to aim at the incoming monsters from all directions and shoot them down while the jet follows a pre-set path. Facing bosses requires you to target specific weak points while your fighter circles around and at all times you can call Gamera to aid you by instructing it to shoot its homing attacks, as well as a charged attack that clears all enemies on screen. Some stages switch the action to ground level, as you pilot a futuristic bike, but the gameplay remains the same. Features polygonal graphics and live action FMV sequences that advance the plot between each stage.</desc>

		<desc>Players control Shrek on a quest to find ten missing picnic items stolen by the Three Blind Mice. The result is an adventure through ten different locales linked together by the swamp. Players guide Shrek from a third-person perspective as they avoid mischievous swamp critters trying to stun them. Each area contains a mini-game that will reveal one of the lost picnic items once completed. The catch? Shrek must first collect a specific number of items to gain access to the mini-game.</desc>

		<name>Wolf Fang - Kuuga 2001</name>
		<desc>Wolf Fang known outside of Japan as Rohga: Armor Force, is a 1991 run and gun/platform hybrid arcade game developed and published by Data East. It is the sequel to Vapor Trail: Hyper Offence Formation and was followed by Skull Fang Kuhga Gaiden. STORY: Two years have passed since the military occupation of New York City in 1999 and since then Ragnarok (aka: DAGGER) - the organization responsible for the events - have disappeared following their air borne destruction. During that time, mech technology has been the boom of future military projects worldwide with the biggest factories residing in Oceania. These mechs become the main target of Ragnarok when it resurfaces and claims the military factories and cities of Australia and New Zealand. Their plan is to apparently use any and all of the deadliest mechs that have not yet reached completion to their chaotic liking. The USAF and RAAF organize a strike force to reclaim major attacked points in the two countries with the assistance of the best mech operators they can find. Players then assume the role of mech-fighters who aim to liberate Australia or, depending on the player's actions, New Zealand. GAMEPLAY: Wolf Fang plays very much like a scrolling horizontal shooter in which players are set on a scrolling background and must destroy every enemy in their path. However, because the players control a mech, the players can hover against slanted walls in the back ground and occasionally land on higher platforms Players start along the shores of Australia and proceed to Sydney before being allowed to choose where to go from there. If players continue to explore Australia, then they will have a variety of places to choose from while if they pick New Zealand then they will have even more, different levels to choose from with different settings. PSX Version: Wolf Fang was ported to the Sony PlayStation and Sega Saturn in 1996 and 1997 respectively by conversion company Xing (famous for the arcade port collection known as Arcade Gears). The console versions have added features such as a new title screen, new introduction, an arranged soundtrack and a staff roll after the endings. The arcade versions outside Japan however, have a number of things cut. There is no story intermissions between the stages and there is no stage selection leading to 4 different endings found on the Japanese version, but the game cycles through all 12 stages like in the Japanese version's expert mode.</desc>

Rampage Through Time, the fourth installment, is played in a similar fashion to the previous games with a few new features. As the title implies, Rampage Through Time adds a time-travel element. Your oversized mutants travel to time periods such as the Old West and Medieval times, as well as other, more general historical periods, like "war zone," "alien," and "gangster."</desc>

		<path>./Destruction Derby RAW.chd</path>
		<name>Destruction Derby Raw</name>
		<desc>Though not a product of Psygnosis, Destruction Derby Raw retains the same emphasis on wanton vehicular destruction as its forebears. "Wreckin' Racing," "Battle," "Smash 4 $," are the three main modes of play, each offering additional sub-modes. Wreckin' Racing provides some sense of more traditional racing, in that the goal is to finish each track in one of the top three positions in order to advance through a championship circuit, unlocking courses (31 in all) all the while. Knocking the opposition around is not entirely discouraged either. Battle enables four players to compete in split-screen competition across varying "disciplines." The Assault sub-mode is simply a last-man-standing event in which competitors battle head-to-head. Here, options such as the track and lap count can be adjusted as desired. The Destruction Derby event, a series staple, now offers Classic and Arena variations. In Skyscraper, players aim to push one another off the roof of a tall building. Last of all is Pass Da Bomb, where the object is, of course, to not have possession of the bomb. Smash 4 $ mode is fairly self-explanatory. To earn money (functionally equivalent to points), players are expected to liberally dole out damage to any of the other racers. High-speed collisions satisfy the basic requirement for "stunts." By pulling off a Corkscrew, Teeth Puller, or Bone Cruncher, players earn these much-needed points, and also cause real-time damage to the unlucky recipient's car. Point totals and finishing place all count towards a final point tally, which is in turn measured against a predetermined value. Players must earn enough to continue on to the next event. Accumulated cash can then be spent to upgrade or repair your vehicle.</desc>

Reploids were sent in to terraform the land in an attempt to make the planet habitable for humans once more, however, a Reploid and former colleague of Alia named Gate discovered something unusual amidst the ruins of Earth — a piece of Zero's DNA. After examining Zero's DNA, Gate became mad with power and an outbreak of bizarre Mavericks occurred. Weeks passed, Isoc, a Reploid scientist and an associate of Gate, announced to the people that a new phenomenon known as "Nightmare" has quickly spread throughout the world, causing Reploids to hallucinate and eventually destroy themselves. Isoc suspects the cause of the outbreak is none other than Zero who been spreading the phenomenon as he goes, much to X's anger and confusion. Isoc rallies Reploids throughout the world to aid the Nightmare Investigators, led by the powerful High-Max, at key locations to track down the source of this new phenomenon as well as Zero. X, along with the Maverick Hunters, must confront the Nightmare Investigators as they try to solve the mystery behind the Nightmare Phenomenon and clear Zero's name.</desc>

		<name>X2 : No Relief</name>
		<desc>X2 is the sequel only released on Playstation of one of the best shooters on Commodore Amiga: Project-X. Project-X is a scrolling shooter game for the Amiga computer released in 1992. It was also ported to DOS. Developed and published by Team17, it was regarded as one of the best shooter games for that platform at the time, both for its technical excellence in graphics and sounds, and for its difficult and interesting gameplay[citation needed]. The game resembles Konami's side-scrolling shooter games such as Gradius, Salamander and Parodius. X2, sometimes known as Project X-2 is a simple but technically impressive, arcade-style side scrolling shoot 'em up released during the Team17-Ocean collaboration era of video games that created the Worms series. It is the sequel to the Amiga 16-bit shooter Project-X. Unlike many other games of the era, it was never released to a home computer audience and was fairly poorly received[citation needed]: this was mainly due to 2D scrolling shooters losing appeal in general public eye at the end of the Nineties, in favor of 3D games. The game was released in Eastern territories by Capcom, who handle such releases for many Western games including Grand Theft Auto III. Capcom and Team17 worked together to make the game more palatable for the Eastern market. The game's plot is about an alien invasion on earth and the player controls the only one (or 2 if he choose the 2 player game) who can stop it. The game features 10 levels and a final level of fast paced action and really difficult gameplay. Huge boss monsters at the end of each level. Each enemy wave is different, memorizing patterns won't help you... Team17 claims there is absolutely NO slowdown in this game, even in two player co-op mode!</desc>

As the bounty hunter Lay or the young priestess Cress, players must venture across the lands en route to a final showdown with the evil force behind the chaos. Floating Runner: Quest for the 7 Crystals is a 3D platform adventure consisting of fourteen levels across seven different themed environments, with classic locales ranging from tropical forests to frozen tundra.

While avoiding the treacherous chasms and gaps that permeate the floating worlds, players will need to seek out special gems while keeping an eye on the time remaining to complete each world. Continues are unlimited so failure is little more than a temporary hindrance.</desc>

		<name>Rockman 3 : Dr. Wily no Saigo!</name>
		<desc>Mega Man 3 acontece em um ano não especificado durante o século XXI (20XX). O cientista louco Dr. Wily, tendo duas vezes seus planos frustrados para dominar o mundo, afirma ter se reformado e começa a trabalhar com o Dr. Light em um projeto para construir um robô de manutenção da paz chamado "Gamma". Oito Robot Masters encarregados de tarefas de mineração enlouquecem e fogem com os oito cristais de energia de Gamma. Mega Man é chamado à ação, desta vez com um companheiro canino chamado Rush, para recuperar os cristais dos locais. Ao longo de sua missão, o protagonista continuamente encontra e luta com Proto Man, um inimigo mascarado que tem habilidades comparáveis ??às do próprio Mega Man. Depois que Mega Man destrói os oito Robot Masters, ele revisita quatro dos locais de mineração para enfrentar oito "Doc Robots", que possuem as habilidades dos Robot Masters de Mega Man II. Depois que os cristais são recuperados, Wily retorna aos seus maus caminhos, rouba Gama e se retira para sua nova fortaleza. Para deter o mais novo plano de Wily para conquistar o mundo, Mega Man destrói Gamma e derrota Wily em um confronto final. Como a fortaleza começa a desmoronar, Proto Man aparece em tempo suficiente para salvar Mega Man, mas é tarde demais para salvar Wily, que é visto sendo esmagado sob os escombros. Quando Mega Man recupera a consciência no laboratório do Dr. Light, seu criador informa que ele deve ter sido resgatado pelo Proto Man, e suas anotações revelam que o Proto Man é, de fato, o irmão mais velho de Mega Man.</desc>

There are three different characters that can be played as, each with their own weapon and fighting style. Various magic scrolls can be found by defeating enemies which allow the player to cast several different types of spells including lightning and fire. The story itself concerns an evil being who sets out looking for a Power Stone and cuts down all in his path with his sword, the Sol Divide. It is up to you to stop him, battling your way through several stages in both Arcade and Original Mode (which contain different areas and require different tactics to beat, the Original Mode being designed as a more difficult experience for players who want to progress on to a higher challenge). Defeating enemies rewards the player with different items to help them on their journey, including the aforementioned magic scrolls, healing potions, magic bottles (only when playing Arcade Mode) and protection accessories (if playing Original Mode).</desc>

The gameplay is very similar to X-Men: Children of the Atom, but with a simplified Super Combo gauge and the addition of infinity gems. Each character starts with a set of gems. These can be activated during a fight to improve speed, power and defence, or provide special abilities to create crushing stone walls, open up a rift in space, or reverse the opponent's controls. The use of the gems is inspired by the The Infinity Gauntlet comic book series.</desc>

		<name>Space Jam</name>
		<desc>Based on the movie of the same name, Space Jam centres around an invasion of Looney Tunes land by tiny aliens. The fate of the Tunes is to be decided by a basketball game, and for this the aliens turn into the huge, evil Monstars. The game is about two thirds basketball sim and then minigames are stuck in to fill all the gaps. You can play as the Monstars or the Looney Tunes who have the help of Michael Jordan. The basketball games themselves come in two flavours, two-on-two and three-on-three. Successful completion of the minigames upgrades your character's abilities on the court. There are several - one involves finding MJ's basketball togs, one is a space race in the style of the retro Micro Machines games. There are about five minigames in all, and a player from both teams participates. The multiplayer is a big aspect of the game. There is the traditional two-player versus, one team Tunes, one team Monstars, and there is also co-operative mode. In this two or even three players can play on the same team. Using multitaps, you can actually have a three-on-three game. The Tunes roster is made up of Michael Jordan, Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Lola Bunny, Taz, Foghorn Leghorn, Pepé Le Pew, Sylvester, Wile E. Coyote, Porky Pig, Elmer Fudd and Yosemite Sam. The Monstars have access to Pound, Bupkus, Bang, Blanko and Nawt. There are three statistics in the game, namely Speed, Shooting and Rebounds. These are pretty self-explanatory, but there is another more subtle one that's similar to stamina. Throughout the course of play your characters will get tired and lose their focus. A successful slam dunk usually tops this up. The closest thing the game has to a single player mode is the Intergalactic Tournament (though it can be played multiplayer). This is a series of five matches in a row. One captain is picked and plays every game, while the rest of the team is substituted in and out. There is no real way to progress in the game as it does not support memory cards. Space Jam has more of an arcade, lighthearted feel to it.</desc>

		<desc>Featuring ten tanks from World War II, Mobile Armor is a mission-based shooter in which you control the "Mars army tank" in battle against a succession of "Earth army tanks." Completed missions in single-player story mode become available for two-player free mode, with one player manning the cannons and the other the tank, as well as for two-player VS mode. In VS mode, five tanks are available from cleared story mode missions, with another five added based on the number of cumulative defeated Earth army tanks. Tanks are rated in speed, range, power, energy, armor level, and recovery ability, and can be upgraded with generic equipment such as a Hyper Engine, L-Range Unit, Armor A, B, and C, Super Cannon, and Spare Energy. In-game screen displays show radar, opponent's tank, speed gauge, energy gauge, lock-on sights, armor level, and movement. Damage is calculated based on the distance between combatants. Closer shots are more damaging but being too close or behind a wall may actually prevent a shot. Features: Ten simulated tanks from WWII era Completing missions in single-player story mode opens areas for two-player free or VS modes Separate controls for tank and cannon movement</desc>

		<name>Spec Ops : Covert Assault</name>
		<desc>Spec Ops: Covert Assault is the third game in the budget-priced Spec Ops line for the PlayStation. The series takes the first-person shooter genre and attempts to fuse it with aspects of real combat, in the hopes of giving players a sense of what it is actually like to take on dangerous black ops military missions. Covert Assault is no different in this regard, as you'll take on the role of two different elite rangers as they scour the globe, quietly ridding it of evil at every turn. In Covert Assault, you choose two rangers from a host of different soldiers with their own abilities. Select from the machine gunner, close-quarters fighter, sniper, grenadier, and rifleman. Once you've chosen your rangers, you will be able to customize them with a whole host of different guns and items such as body armor and grenades. You then enter into the game, which is made up of four different missions, ranging from the island of Sicily to the deep anonymous jungles of a far away place.</desc>

		<path>./Turnabout (USA).chd</path>
		<name>Turnabout</name>
		<desc>While the old adage that "turnabout is fair play" applies in many situations, Natsume's Turnabout is all about diabolical puzzles where players rotate the entire puzzle while the pieces move within its borders, sliding and rolling into mind-numbing configurations and patterns. The 100 puzzles provided are divided into two groups of 50: Begin Mode and Main Mode. The first 50 puzzles must be solved in order to open up the remaining 50, but the puzzles are numbered in five rows of ten each -- solving seven rounds in a row will open up the next row of ten, thus the puzzles needn't be solved sequentially. Puzzle pieces in Turnabout come in three types: colored balls, colored blocks, and sliding blocks. By rotating the puzzle board, balls and sliding blocks adhere to the forces of gravity and fall down into open slots. Manipulating the puzzle correctly takes skill and usually no more than ten to fifteen "steps," even at advanced levels. Learning to solve puzzles backward by picturing the flow of the pieces mentally can be an essential tool to success and none of the 100 puzzle board configurations are the same shape. For players looking for even more challenges, up to 50 custom-made puzzles can be devised, using five different colored balls and blocks and nine movable sliders (blocks) in Edit Mode. Features: * One hundred puzzles with moving balls and sliding blocks * Create up to 50 additional custom puzzles in edit mode * Background, sound, and music options allow customization of playing fields</desc>

		<name>Q*bert</name>
		<desc>Hasbro Interactive continues their series of classic Arcade game remakes with Q*bert for the PlayStation. In this disc you'll find the original game, a new Adventure mode and a special Head-To-Head contest. Those of you who misspent your youths in the Arcades will recall that the original Q*bert stars a little round orange guy with bulging eyes, a round snout for a nose, short legs and no arms or torso. Your job is to hop Q*bert around a pyramid of cubes and change the colors of the cubes to a target color. In later rounds, you will need to change the colors of the cubes more than once in order to achieve your goal. Once the entire pyramid has been changed to the target color, you advance to a new pyramid. While you are hopping Q*bert up and down the cubes of each pyramid, enemies, most of which are deadly to the touch, will try and stop your progress. Another way to die is to hop off of the pyramid without landing on one of the three discs that are placed above and beside the pyramid. These discs are useful when enemies, such as Coily the snake (Q*bert's archenemy), are in hot pursuit. Green enemies and objects can (and should be) be touched, and some of them cause trouble. For example, Slick and Sam wreak havoc by hopping on cubes and changing their color.</desc>

El Diablo, the Lord of the Underworld, sees this and being incapable of creating his own music, steals Johnny's guitar Anita and has his demons kidnap great musical legends from around the planet. Johnny manages to avoid the goon squads and follows them back to the underworld. There, armed with a bazooka-guitar, he is ready to wreak havoc on the bad guys in an attempt to rescue his true love, Anita. This cartoon-style game is set in the year 2050 A.D. and features various special effects and scenery commensurate with the hellish Underworld setting. Movement includes 360-degree spin jumps, hover jumps and other standard 3D scrolling action. As you play, not only can you shoot unlimited blasts from your guitar gun but you can power it up to release a powerful sonic blast that will fry anything within hearing range. In Johnny Bazookatone, you'll use ordinary and super-weapons, get power-ups and search for secret passages that lead to bonus levels. The CD also contains some bonus music tracks.</desc>

		<desc>Introducing Lammy, a totally rockin' guitarist. In day-to-day life, she's quite timid, shy, and wimpy - but put a guitar in her hands, and she'll blow you away! Help Lammy get to her latest gig on time, and face obstacles such as flaming buildings, out-of-control airplanes, and even getting trapped in Hell. In this sequel to PaRappa The Rapper you play as Lammy, a guitarist for MilkCan - the coolest, hippest band ever! While PaRappa focused on lyrics, with each button controlling a different word; Lammy is a guitar player, so naturally, each button controls a different note on the guitar. Lammy will encounter seven different teachers on her travels to the big gig, so either follow their lessons accurately, or do even better - improvise and blow them all away with your axe. The teacher will then step away for you to go it solo for an even better performance. Lammy improves over PaRappa in a multitude of ways. Rather than just being a single player experience, you can now play the game with a friend. Any stages that you unlock can be played either co-operatively or competitively. If you don't have a friend to play co-operatively with, you can also get the computer to take on the role of your partner. After finishing the initial game, PaRappa also makes a return, allowing you to play through the game again with raps instead of Lammy's guitar.</desc>

		<desc>The Compati Hero Series is a video game series published exclusively in Japan by Banpresto and Namco Bandai Games (formerly Bandai) that began in 1990, that serves as crossover between Ultraman, Kamen Rider (also known as Masked Rider) and Gundam. It was the first video game series to involve a crossover between animated giant robots and live action tokusatsu heroes from different established franchises. The series makes this possible by using caricaturized versions of the characters (officially referred as "SD" or "Super Deformed" characters), which allowed the different heroes and villains to co-exist and interact with each other without the need to reconcile their contrasting styles and settings.</desc>

Além disso, algumas áreas ocultas dos níveis só podem ser acessadas usando certas armas de robôs capturadas.nnnnViajando por todos esses níveis, Mega Man é confrontado por um exército de criações de robôs menores que quando destruídos geralmente derrubam cápsulas de energia (para reabastecer sua energia), cápsulas de armas (para reabastecer as armas coletadas de robôs) e vidas extras em forma de cabeça de Mega Man.</desc>

		<desc>Colonel Dahar, leader of the Mars Imperial Army, has brought his forces to attack Earth, seeking to take the remains of an ancient civilization by force. A young girl named Momolita, living with an old inventor and a group of machine pilots in a small Earth city, seems to have some kind of connection to this mysterious ancient civilization. When Momolita is captured by the Mars Imperial Army, it's up to Ridegear pilot Ken and his friends to rescue her, and bring the fist of justice crashing down on Colonel Dahar! Ridegear Guybrave is a side-scrolling action game with RPG elements. One or two players select from the four available characters, hop into their Ridegear mechs, and head out to fight for justice. Each character pilots their own unique Ridegear, and it is possible to buy a variety of different upgrades for each, including main and sub weapons, shields, and engines. Defeating enemies will also earn experience, and leveling up will increase each character's life meter and unlock new moves. In addition to the main story mode, there is also a 1-on-1 Coliseum mode for one or two players. It is possible to use upgraded machines from the story mode, and new machines are unlocked for use as the story progresses.</desc>

		<name>Gunpey</name>
		<desc>Gunpey is a puzzle game set in the wild west. Your goal is to connect pieces of fuses to get one long fuse going across the board, making it explode and disappear. There are several game modes in Gunpey, such as the classical puzzle game modes "Endless mode", where you can either play until you mess up or timed, either for 2 or 5 minutes. "Stage mode", where you have to clear a certain amount of tiles before advancing to the next stage. "Puzzle mode", where you have a set amount of fuse pieces and you need to make them all go away in one explosion. And finally "Vs. mode", where you can face off against a friend. The game was named as a tribute to the developer of the game, Gunpei Yokoi who died from a car accident. He is also the designer of the Wonderswan and Nintendo's Game Boy system. Gameplay: Gunpey offers a one-of-a-kind puzzle experience. As lines of various angles climb up the screen, the player?s objective is to flip the lines, located in squares, to connect them over five columns.

The original Japanese version of the game stars a girl named Mai Tsurugino. A spirit detective named Doro finds Mai and asks her to help him attack monsters. Makeruna Makendo 2, the second one in the series is a conversion of the Super Famicom fave with anime girls in 2D fighting arena and superfluous super moves. Some over the top stages too with ballet stages, football stadiums and bussling, downtown nightime Osaka. The Ghost Prime Minister is holding a fighting tournament, and 14-year-old Hikari Tsurugino, the second Mighty Makendo, must face off against all sort of strange apparitions. Characters from the first game make appearances, including Mai Tsurugino, Hikari's sister and the first Mighty Makendo. Makeruna! Makendo 2 is a comical VS fighting game with an eclectic cast of characters including a soccer player, a zombie, a musclebound mer-man, and a giant robot. Bouts are best two-out-of-three, and each character has both a life bar and a "Makendo" meter, which lets each character perform a variety of special attacks. The game includes a story mode and a 2-player versus mode. There are eight selectables characters.</desc>

		<name>Night Raid</name>
		<desc>Night Raid is the fourth shmup by Takumi. Apparently a rushed-up job (in the sense that Taito forced the development in a few moments, to have more wiggling shmups,so to speak) it runs on G-Net hardware and features an interesting but a bit unpolished gameplay, questionable graphics and a great soundtrack. Night Raid employs a unique twist on the "sub-weapon that makes you invincible" system. The Hug Launcher must be shot at an enemy and only if it hits something do you become invincible: i.e., you can't use it as a last-ditch escape from pastel maelstrom death, you have to plan it?s use deliberately. And the Hug Launcher does not have a specified time over which it is effective. By repeatedly tapping the X-Button once you've released the attack, you can begin to build a combo, so long as there are enemies on the screen (you can get even higher combos by directing the Hug Launcher with the control pad as you tap X), at this point, your ship is invulnerable, so keep your eye on where the Hug Launcher is going. One thing that does irk me though is that both of the intros (the arcade intro and a new rendered home intro) are both FMV when its obvious that the original arcade intro was real-time The PSX version removed the 2001 arcade version's 2-player option.</desc>

		<name>The King of Fighters '96</name>
		<desc>The King of Fighters '96 is a 1996 fighting game released by SNK for the Neo Geo arcade and home consoles. It is the third game in The King of Fighters series, following The King of Fighters '95. Like its predecessor, the game was ported to the Neo-Geo CD, as well as the PlayStation and Sega Saturn. Unlike the previous game, the PlayStation and Saturn versions were released only in Japan, with a language setting allowing the player to set the game to English. It is also part of the compilation The King of Fighters Collection: The Orochi Saga for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable and Wii. It was also released on the Wii Virtual Console in Japan on February 15, 2011. The King of Fighters '96 has 27 regular characters plus 2 boss characters (who can be unlocked with the use of a code). Newcomers to the tournament include Mr. Big from the Art of Fighting series, the bosses from Fatal Fury (Wolfgang Krauser and Geese Howard), and completely original characters like Leona Heidern, Mature and Vice. Other features carried over from the previous year include the ability to choose between the default "Team Fighting" mode or the traditional "Single Fighter" style of gameplay, plus the "Versus" and "Survival" gameplay modes. GAMEPLAY: KOF '96 made a few slight changes to the gameplay of previous KOF games by introducing new techniques. The Dodge technique from the previous two game is replaced by an "emergency evasion" or "attack deflector" technique, which allows the player's character to roll away or towards the opponent. In the latter case, the player can have the ability to roll towards the opponent and end up at the other side. The player can also determine the height of their jump and perform small or high jumps. Additionally, the graphics for all the character sprites from the previous games were redrawn and the commands for certain Special and Super moves were changed from previous games. Like in the previous, Super Special Moves can be performed when the Power Gauge is filled up or when the player's life gauge is flashing red. However, the player can also perform a more powerful version of their regular Super move if both conditions are met (the player has low energy and Maximum level power gauge). STORY: A new King of Fighters tournament was announced, though the letters of invitation sent out to the fighters were no longer sent by Rugal Bernstein. The letters also announced many changes, the first of which being a massive overhaul of the tournament's approach. During the time that had passed between the tournaments since the previous year, the King of Fighters tournament's fame had grown immensely, to the point that it turned into a major international event, which had not happened before. Huge corporations transformed the King of Fighters tournament into something widely televised, commercialized, and celebrated, drawing in many crowds from around the world. The tournament is now held by Chizuru Kagura, a descendant of the ancient Yata Clan responsible for sealing the Orochi demon along with the Kusanagi and Yasanaki clans (the clans from Kyo Kusanagi and Iori Yagami, respectively). Chizuru uses the tournament in hopes of finding and recruiting Kyo and Iori in order to stop the upcoming Orochi threat, but Kyo and Iori aren't exactly willing to work together on friendly terms. CHARACTERS: The character roster underwent major changes since the previous game. The Rival Team was disbanded, with only Iori Yagami returning, while Heidern and Takuma Sakazaki retired from the tournament. Takuma's spot in the Art of Fighting Team was taken by his daughter Yuri Sakazaki, formerly with the Women Fighters Team. New characters introduced in this episode include Kasumi Todoh from Art of Fighting 3, who takes Yuri's place in the Women Fighters Team; Leona, who joins the Ikari Team in place of her mentor and adoptive father, Heidern; Mature and Vice, two of Rugal's assistants who join Iori Yagami as members of the new Yagami Team; and the Boss Team, composed of Geese Howard, Wolfgang Krauser, and Mr. Big, all villains from the Fatal Fury and Art of Fighting series. The new boss character is Goenitz, a servant from Orochi who wants to stop Chizuru's plans of sealing his master.</desc>

		<name>The King of Fighters '98 : Dream Match Never Ends</name>
		<desc>The King of Fighters, officially abbreviated KOF, is a series of fighting games by SNK Playmore, formerly SNK. The series was originally developed for SNK's Neo-Geo MVS arcade hardware, which served as the main platform for the series until 2004, when SNK retired the MVS in favor of the Atomiswave arcade board and will move the series to the Taito Type X2 with the release of The King of Fighters XII. Ports of the arcade games and original The King of Fighters games have been released for the Neo Geo CD, Neo Geo Pocket, Game Boy and Game Boy Advance, N-Gage, Sega Saturn and Sega Dreamcast, PlayStation and PlayStation 2, PC, and Xbox. One of the most recent games in the series are KOF: Maximum Impact series. The initial storyline follows Kyo Kusanagi, a young Japanese who enters The King of Fighters tournaments. Being the heir of the ancient Kusanagi clan, who wield pyrokinetic powers, Kyo manages to use its powerful techniques to become champion of the tournament along with his friends. Kyo and his friends find themsleves meeting the host of the events: a powerful criminal named Rugal Bernstein, who wants to find worthy opponents to kill so that he can turn them into statues in order to remember his ruthless victories but is defeated. In the 1995 KOF tournament, it is revealed the entity of Orochi: an ancient eight-headed demon who was sealed by the three ancient artifacts of Japan. Rugal tries to use it but dies in the process. In this game, a fighter named Iori Yagami appears aiming to kill Kyo and destroy the Kusanagi clan, as revenge for the Yagami clan. In 1996, a new tournament is organized by the heir of the Yata clan, Chizuru Kagura, who wants to gather Kyo and Iori in her team to seal the Orochi demon, as their clans had done in the past. During the '97 tournament, a group known as the New Faces team learn of their past as being three of Orochi's Four Heralds and decide to awake Orochi. Kyo and Iori decide to join Chizuru to stop them and although they succeed in defeating them, Orochi is able to revive through the use of his Heralds' sacrifices. Joining their forces, Kyo, Iori, and Chizuru defeat and seal Orochi once again, however Kyo and Iori disappear during the aftermath of the battle. The King of Fighters '98 was released on July 23, 1998 and unlike previous games it did not feature a story; instead, the game allows players to play with most of characters available on previous ones, including ones that were supposedly dead. SNK refitted the Sega Dreamcast version renaming it The King of Fighters: Dream Match 1999 with an extended cel animated introduction and 3D backgrounds. A remake titled Ultimate Match was released in Japanese arcades on March 18, 2008 and later on some video game consoles expanding the character roster and improving the graphics. The Playstation version features an Art Gallery with illustration gallery, unused art and a secret ending demo unlockble, this version is also vibration function compatible.</desc>

Then when next you press Jump, he'll either launch himself way straight up (backspin) or a long way forward (front spin). And of course there's plenty of call to use the spin jumps</desc>

		<name>The King of Fighters '97</name>
		<desc>Another year, another KOF. Additions this year come in the form of slightly improved graphics and sounds, new moves and a new game mode. Gameplay is much more plot-driven, as you have middle-bosses that can change depending on what team you select. In addition, there are several special endings which are only shown when certain "Edit Team" combinations are selected. As of The King of Fighters '97, you can play in either the Extra or Advanced game modes. Extra Mode is the typical AOF/KOF scheme, in which your power gauge fills up as you defend yourself or charge yourself up. The new Advanced Mode, on the other hand, only allows you to charge your gauge as you perform special moves and attacks, similar to the Street Fighter series. Extra allows one to sidestep attacks while Advanced allows the character to roll past and dodge attacks; Advanced also allow a character to perform a potent "Super Desperation Move" (or SDM) at any time provided the character has at least two full bars of charged energy stored. In contrast, SDMs can only be performed in Extra when a character has less than a quarter of their health left. New characters include the New Face Team, the Fatal Fury Outlaw Team (featuring the KOF debut of "Blue" Mary Ryan and Ryuji Yamazaki, and the return of Billy Kane), and Kyo's pupil Shingo Yabuki. In total, The King of Fighters '97 sports 29 separate characters (without counting the six Orochi-related boss characters, which are all accessible via a secret code). The Playstation version features 2 artwork gallery &amp; unlocklable demo mode that is sort of a movie in which all the sequences of the team in which the player completed the game can be watched.</desc>

		<name>Mad Panic Coaster</name>
		<desc>In Mad Panic Coaster, you control a boy and a girl (perhaps a brother and sister?) as they sit in a roller coaster car and go through 15 hellish roller coasters. How these roller coasters even got past safety testing is unknown, as they don't have any rails or barriers of any sort. It's up to you to steer the roller coaster car using the d-pad to make sure it stays on the track. The roller coasters also have various monsters, traps, and jumps to avoid. To do this, you use X to jump. Hitting Square will make the girl throw some sort of yellow ball projectile that explodes at a long range, while hitting Circle will make the boy throw that same type of projectile at a shorter range. Falling off the track or getting hit by something will cost you health, and once you run out, you must start the level all over again. Once you make three laps around the track, a rainbow with the words "lucky" form around you as they come to a stop, and you move on to the next level. Every three roller coasters, a boss will be fought after completing the third lap. This boss is similar to the regular enemies, except that they take many more hits to kill. To defeat them, you has to either throw enough projectiles at them or survive another three laps. The levels take you through a plethora of locations, ranging from scary castles to the ocean to Wonderland to the inner cities. Each roller coaster has its own unique enemies, and while the game may move too fast for you to see these enemies in close detail, pausing can show that a lot of work went into these details. Most of the game is constructed out of polygons, but the boy and girl are sprites, allowing them to appear more expressive than PS1-era polygonal characters would typically allow. The music, while slightly limited in terms of variety, is fitting for what goes on in the game, consisting mainly of instrumental thrash metal and hardcore punk tracks.</desc>

		<desc>PuLiRuLa (Pu-Li-Ru-La) is a 1991 arcade game released by Taito. The game was later ported to the FM Towns Marty, Sega Saturn, PlayStation, and PlayStation 2 in Japan. The PS1 and Saturn versions are known as Pu-Li-Ru-La Arcade Gears. The PS2 version is part of a compilation called Taito Memories (Volume 1), but omitted from the international release of Taito Legends. PuLiRuLa is known for its distinct graphics and odd story line. PuLiRuLa takes place in Radishland, a land where time is kept correctly flowing with a time key. However, "a bad man appeared and stole the time key to stop the time flow. The towns were attacked one by one, the time flow was stopped and they received damage", as the English translation explains. Zac and Mel, the playable characters, are requested by an old man to defend their town. The old man also gives the children a "magic stick" to fight with.</desc>

		<name>PaRappa the Rapper</name>
		<desc>The rapping pup, PaRappa, dreams of impressing his friend, the beautiful Sunny Funny, and going out on a date with her. But what he lacks is confidence - help PaRappa rap his way through learning Kung Fu, a driving test, cooking and more, all in order to get the girl. And remember - You Gotta Believe! PaRappa the Rapper is a game based on lyrics, music and rhythm. The game itself is very basic - each stage has a 'teacher', that PaRappa must follow. You'll see the teacher say some lyrics, and then PaRappa must copy the teacher by pressing the appropriate buttons to repeat those lyrics back. Rap well, and you'll be able to continue; fudge up the lyrics, and the music will start to distort and the teacher will become displeased. Continue to mess up and you'll fail the stage. Of course, the goal is not to copy the teacher, but instead to outperform them - you can do this by improvising in the song's gaps. Listen to how the song goes, and improvise in time to the music; if you perform well enough, the teacher will step aside, leaving you to freestyle on your own! The PSP version of the game is a remake of the PlayStation original. However, it includes a few upgrades, such as a 16:9 display, sharper graphics, game sharing, multiplayer support of up to four players, and the addition of song remixes, which can be downloaded via the internet onto your Memory Stick Duo.</desc>

Naturally, the game is violent and includes the notorious Fatality moves, but "Babalities" and "Friendships" were added to appease (actually, to poke fun at) citizens groups concerned with the series' high level of blood and gore. These kinder, gentler finishing moves include such things as turning your opponent into a baby and giving him or her a bouquet of flowers.</desc>

		<name>Strikers 1945 II</name>
		<desc>Strikers 1945 pits you in the middle of World War II and offers several fighters, jets, and bombers based on period aircraft during the period. Fighters include the Lightning, Flying Pancake, Ta152 Focke Wulf, Hayate, Shinden and Mosquito. The game is played from a top-down perspective and is reminiscent of 1942 and 1943 by Capcom. Enemies include various forms of fighter jets swarming the player throughout each level, as well as mid- and end-mission bosses, some of which take up half the player's screen. Destroying onscreen enemies and obtaining power-ups will affect the standard guns on the fighter you are piloting. Traditional powering up of weapons leads to more guns shooting at once as well as additional tracking bullets and lasers. Each fighter also has a custom special weapon that can be used when enemy situations get too hectic. For example, using the Pancake's special weapon will call in two stealth bombers that will not only shield you from oncoming attacks for several seconds, but also attack all onscreen enemies. Each aircraft has a charge bar at the bottom left hand corner of the screen. Destroying enemies causes this bar fill up, and once a desirable level has been reached, the attack button can be held down to "charge" a super weapon that can help you dispatch enemies easier. Strikers 1945 also features seven difficulty levels: Monkey, Child, Very Easy, Easy, Medium, Hard and Very Hard. Each setting affects the number of onscreen enemies as well as the challenge involved in dispatching them. This game uses one block on the standard memory card to save high scores, and a two-player simultaneous mode is also supported. In the PSX NTSC-U version one major change has been made: The Japanese release of Strikers 1945 II on both PSX and Saturn had an optional third mode of presentation: the flip-mode, arcade-style scroll for those who can flip their TV's.</desc>

		<name>Wonder 3 - Arcade Gears</name>
		<desc>Wonder 3 features three arcade games on one disc. These games all originated from the early 90s. Roosters (Midnight Wanderers),Chariot and Don't Pull The 3 games are as follows (Western names): - Roosters Midnight Wanderers - a lovely action platform game, which bears more than a passing resemblence to Ghouls 'n' Ghosts. It's a lot more colourful than that game, and it a little easy, but if you watch your continues, you'll have great fun with this game!. It's also 2 players, which is something GnG never offered. - Chariot - a really gorgeous horizontal shooter. Bearing a slight resemblance to Cotton, or even Parodius, only with much bigger sprited/enemies, the game has an amazingly colourful dreamlike look which may have been slighlly inspired by the film 'The Never Ending Story.' Don't let that put, you off, I guess you'll understand when you play it. The important thing is, the game is fantastic, and everyone I know who has played it said they would have bought it as a full priced game on it's own. - Don't Pull - It's a simple puzzle game, but amazingly, it's my pick of the bunch. I actually used to own the arcade PCB, and this is the game I had most fun with. I'd pretty much say this game is as fun as classics like Splash Lake and Bomberman!</desc>

		<name>Double Dragon</name>
		<desc>Double Dragon 6-1 is a 1995 fighting game spinoff of the Double Dragon series developed and published by Technos Japan. It is based on the 1994 Double Dragon movie, which in turn was based on the original arcade game. It was originally released for the Neo Geo (in AES and MVS formats) and later released for the Neo Geo CD and PlayStation (the latter ported by Urban Plant). It was Technos Japan's last Double Dragon game before the company went out of business. The game plays like a conventional fighting game of its time, that is battles are one-on-one and conducted on best two-out-of-three matches. One of the unique aspects of Double Dragon is the lack of specific punch and kick buttons like most fighting games. Instead, there are four attack buttons of varying strength and speed, which can perform punches or kicks depending on the character's position. The player's character and his opponent have a super move meter called the "charge meter", which is overlaid on the character's remaining health. The less health the character has, the quicker it will fill up. "Charge moves" are usually performed by executing the command of a regular special move and pressing two attack buttons simultaneously at the end instead of just one.</desc>

		<desc>Choujin Gakuen Gowcaizer, also known as Voltage Fighter Gowcaizer is a 1995 superhero-themed head-to-head fighting game produced by Technos Japan Corp. for the Neo Geo arcade and home console. It was the company's third attempt at a fighting game after the success of Capcom's 1991 arcade-hit Street Fighter II, following the 1992 Family Computer title Nekketsu Kakuto Densetsu, and the Neo Geo fighting game version of Double Dragon. It features character designs by artist Masami Obari, who previously worked on the anime adaptations of the Fatal Fury series. Ports of the game were released for the Neo-Geo CD and PlayStation (Japan only). In 1995 it appeared on the Neo Geo then in 1997 it was ported over to the PSX by Urban Plant. Its a VERY RARE game to get hold of now since there never was a reprint of it. Exclusive PSX features: - A new full motion anime intro. - A new 3d mode. It seems like 70% of the sprite animations are missing compared to the arcade version. The PSX exclusive 3D mode is pointless and at best a novelty. The backgrounds and characters are still 2D but the camera moves around. The background is basically a wallpaper on a black background and everything looks very tacky indeed.

He was told not to take the path through Mt. Curse. But everyone in the village looks down on Horin, and he figures if he can make it through Mt. Curse, then maybe he'll start to get a little respect. But he was a little worried; after all, legend says that there are terrible monsters living there. What to do, what to do? So of course, while he's pondering whether or not to make the journey, an earthquake splits the ground beneath his feet, with the only path leading towards Mr. Curse. There's only one thing he can do now... Tiny Bullets is an action-adventure game that plays remarkably similar to Tomb Raider. Horin has a variety of actions he can perform, including jumping, climbing, swinging on poles, pushing blocks, shooting things with his slingshot, and even picking up and throwing small objects. Making his way through different areas, he must fight with monsters, as well as avoid and escape traps. He can also find and store a variety of items, including keys and healing items to keep his health up. There is even an option to get hints on the current stage if you get stuck.</desc>

		<name>Fantastic Night Dreams : Cotton Original</name>
		<desc>The Cotton series is a line of shoot 'em up video game software developed by Success with a long history of releases both in arcades and on home video game consoles. With the series debuting in 1991, the Cotton games have helped to establish the visual style of shoot 'em ups sometimes called cute 'em up. Instead of warships and battle fields typical of most shoot 'em ups, Cotton games put players in control of a witch riding on a broom and tasks them with fighting through magical haunted kingdoms. Cotton games have appeared on a variety of consoles including the NEC PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16, the Super Nintendo, the Mega Drive/Sega Genesis, the Sega Saturn, the PlayStation, the Neo Geo Pocket Color, and the Dreamcast. There is also a pachinko game featuring Cotton available for the PlayStation 2. Most recently, Cotton appears as a hidden character in the Nintendo DS game Rondo of Swords.</desc>

		<desc>Tenchi wo Kurau II - Sekiheki no Tatakai is the Playstation conversion of the arcade machine of the same name released by Capcom in the year 1992. Tenchi wo Kurau II, which uses the manga Tenchi wo Kurau (based on the Romance of the Three Kingdoms story) as the background, and also the sequel of Dynasty Wars (Tenchi wo Kurau in Japan). It was released by Capcom in 1992, an era in which they also published several similar horizontal-scrolling action games such as Final Fight, Captain Commando, King of Dragons, and Knights of the Round. Tenchi wo Kurau II is a beat'em up with 9 stages, in each of which there are large mobs including spearman, archers, strongmen, bomb-wielding opponents, and at least one Wei boss. There can be up to three players on-screen at the same time. Using two buttons, Attack and Jump, the characters all have standard moves typical of Capcom side-scrollers of the day. Common enemies including Wei soldiers such as bandits, privatees, wrestlers, fatties and thieves will keep poping up from everywhere. In the end of each stage there is a Wei general as stage boss. Li Dian, Xiahou Dun, Xu Chu, Zhang Liao, Cao Ren, Xu Huang, the infamous Lu Bu as final boss. After defeating them all, there is also Cao Cao himself who would try to escape. Tenchi wo Kurau II follows Liu Bei's plight in Jingzhou from Romance of the Three Kingdoms, a history-based novel of China, set in the Three Kingdoms period. In Warriors of Fate, Shu Han, led by Liu Bei, as in the novel, was everything "good" and "righteous", while Wei, led by the ever suspicious and cunning Cao Cao, is portrayed as "evil" and "bad". Liu Bei's warriors begin by fighting Cao Cao's forces at the Battle of Bowang, then Battle of Changban, then finally join up with Sun Quan to fight at the Battle of Red Cliff.</desc>

But the monsters in the tower lay eggs, and whoever takes possession of such an egg, can tame a monster which will come out of it, and those monsters, called "familiars", will help their tamers in times of danger. Some brave adventurers dared to enter the tower and to take the eggs. One of them was called Guy. He was killed in the monster tower. Now his son Koh is fifteen, and he is allowed to try his luck in the tower. You control Koh and his party of "familiars" in this unusual "monster-taming" RPG.

Different species have different abilities and need different approach. The battles system is a mixture of real time and turn based combat. Unlike most other console RPGs, there are no special battle screens.</desc>

		<desc>Disney's Dinosaur covers the exploits of a dinosaur that managed to fall off the beaten path. It seems that as an egg, Aladar was stolen and then accidentally dropped onto an island populated by lemurs. The colony took in the little dinosaur and raised him as their own. Players will get to take Aladar and his friends, Zini and Flia, on a journey across 12 different stages. Each of the friends possesses different abilities so players will have to exercise strategy and teamwork to navigate through each level. Want to smash a rock? You'll need Aladar's tail. If you need something airlifted, however, Flia is the only pteranodon in town. Players will have to avoid enemies and traps in this overhead 3D game while they gather items and accomplish level goals. Aladar wants to get back with his own species, but there are carnivores and other more pernicious things lying in wait.</desc>

		<desc>Though not a product of Psygnosis, Destruction Derby Raw retains the same emphasis on wanton vehicular destruction as its forebears. "Wreckin' Racing," "Battle," "Smash 4 $," are the three main modes of play, each offering additional sub-modes. Wreckin' Racing provides some sense of more traditional racing, in that the goal is to finish each track in one of the top three positions in order to advance through a championship circuit, unlocking courses (31 in all) all the while. Knocking the opposition around is not entirely discouraged either. Battle enables four players to compete in split-screen competition across varying "disciplines." The Assault sub-mode is simply a last-man-standing event in which competitors battle head-to-head. Here, options such as the track and lap count can be adjusted as desired. The Destruction Derby event, a series staple, now offers Classic and Arena variations. In Skyscraper, players aim to push one another off the roof of a tall building. Last of all is Pass Da Bomb, where the object is, of course, to not have possession of the bomb. Smash 4 $ mode is fairly self-explanatory. To earn money (functionally equivalent to points), players are expected to liberally dole out damage to any of the other racers. High-speed collisions satisfy the basic requirement for "stunts." By pulling off a Corkscrew, Teeth Puller, or Bone Cruncher, players earn these much-needed points, and also cause real-time damage to the unlucky recipient's car. Point totals and finishing place all count towards a final point tally, which is in turn measured against a predetermined value. Players must earn enough to continue on to the next event. Accumulated cash can then be spent to upgrade or repair your vehicle.</desc>

		<desc>The Cotton series is a line of shoot 'em up video game software developed by Success with a long history of releases both in arcades and on home video game consoles. With the series debuting in 1991, the Cotton games have helped to establish the visual style of shoot 'em ups sometimes called cute 'em up. Instead of warships and battle fields typical of most shoot 'em ups, Cotton games put players in control of a witch riding on a broom and tasks them with fighting through magical haunted kingdoms. Cotton games have appeared on a variety of consoles including the NEC PC Engine/TurboGrafx-16, the Super Nintendo, the Mega Drive/Sega Genesis, the Sega Saturn, the PlayStation, the Neo Geo Pocket Color, and the Dreamcast. There is also a pachinko game featuring Cotton available for the PlayStation 2. Most recently, Cotton appears as a hidden character in the Nintendo DS game Rondo of Swords.</desc>

Along with the loveable Chocobo, Mog makes a glorious return to videogame action.

Together, they set off on a grand adventure looking for pieces of the legendary Blue Crystal.

		<desc>Unlike Activision's earlier remake of an Atari arcade classic, Battlezone, this one stays close to its namesake. Take the original, Atari coin-op game Asteroids, add in the features of the Atari 2600 cartridge, then give it 3-D graphics and a bunch of power-ups, and you've got Activision's Asteroids remake. You are an employee of the Astro-Mining Corporation. Your mission is to simply go to an assigned area of space and clear the area of asteroids and the occassional debris. The game consists of five zones, each with a different background and some with special features. Each zone has 15 levels. In addition to the standard asteroids, there are also mined asteroids that explode; indestructible asteroids that are, well, indestructible; fireball comets; crystal asteroids that regenerate; alien egg asteroids containing deadly baby space worms; and ancient energy asteroids that shoot back! And there's plenty of enemies in addition to the asteroids, such as Standard and Super Saucers, Asteroids Tugs, Fuel Transports, Hexes, Nuke Drivers, and Vulturoids. There are three types of ships to choose from, each with different strengths and weaknesses. There are also three skill levels. If you beat the game at Expert or higher, you gain access to a fourth type of ship. All ships features the standard laser, shield, flip (instantly flips your ship 180 degrees), and hyperspace. There are also limited power-ups you can pick up such as GunSat, Mines, Homing Missiles, Plasma Drill, and Trigger Bombs. The game supports either one or two players. In two player mode, the object is to simply outscore your opponent in a random zone and level. You cannot directly kill your opponent by shooting him, but there are other ways.... Lastly, if you shoot the classic-style asteroid in level 15 of the first zone, you'll find the option of &amp;quot;Classic Asteroids&amp;quot; now appearing on the main menu.</desc>

Ao redor do mundo existem pequenas estrelas azuis que devem ser colocadas em máquinas dos Norns para gerarem uma chave. No entanto, essas estrelas têm tempo de vida limitado, que quanto mais rapidamente são giradas, seu tempo de vida chega ao fim. Quando exatamente 25 estrelas são colocadas em um máquina, será gerado uma chave. Para serem capazes de carregar as estrelas, Norns devem ser treinados desde pequenos. Diferente dos jogos Creatures anteriores, cada Norm deve coletar dez corações para tornarem férteis. Esses corações são encontrados ao redor de Shee Ark, e podem ser coletados por ambos, Scrubby e Norns. Ettins e Grendels são sempre inférteis. Em todo o mundo há uma variedade de plantas medicinais, que de perto, se não exatamente, se assemelham a Ervas de Criaturas. Estas ervas têm efeitos especiais em Norns, como promover o sono, livrar-se de doenças e diminuir o cansaço. Muitas dessas ervas podem causar dependência. Existe também uma grande variedade de ervas daninhas encontradas na Selva Terrarium que podem ser prejudiciais à saúde de um Norn. Como o Jogo Creatures original, os Norns em Creatures: Raised in Space são programadas para morrerem de doença em uma certa idade. O tempo de vida médio de um Norn neste jogo é de cerca de quatro horas.</desc>

		<name>Armorines : Project S.W.A.R.M.</name>
		<desc>A long time ago, in a distant galaxy, an alien race was fighting for survival. Over thousands of years, their society had expanded until their home planet could no longer support the population. The only way to continue their civilization was to look to the stars. For many years the aliens searched for another planet that could support life, and just when they were about to give up hope, they discovered a small, green and blue planet in a distant galaxy - it was perfect, almost too good to be true. A plan of action was devised and swiftly executed. First they sent some breeding pods, these pods were designed to land on the planet and break open, scattering hundreds of aliens over the area. They would then start to colonize the planet in readiness for the main body of aliens, which would travel at a much slower pace in a gigantic spacecraft. These pods landed in a remote part of Siberia and their passengers began to multiply. It was however, not as remote as the bugs had hoped and they found themselves close to a human military base. The bugs waited underground until they were strong and had multiplied sufficiently to take on the humans. When the time was right, the decision was made and the bugs attacked the base - to make ready for the arrival of the main hive. They had to move quickly to spread to other parts of Earth. The military quickly mobilized against the 'bug' threat, but their conventional forces proved to be useless. Overpowered by the toxins emitted by the new enemy, there was only one thing left, a secret, experimental battle suit, originally developed for use by ground forces in nuclear conflict - it's untested, but it's the only chance. They just need someone brave enough to give it a shot... The Armorines: Project S.W.A.R.M. missions may be played by one or two players. There are also four multiplayer modes: Deathmatch, Racewars, Capture the Flag, and King of the Hill.</desc>

		<desc>Following on from the hugely successful Super Karts and Manic Karts games, Formula Karts Special Edition sits you in a motorized sled which is capable of propelling you around 9 miniature race circuits at speeds over 70 mph. Now this may not sound particularly hair-raising but considering that your butt is only six inches from the track surface then only the brave and insane should apply. Championship is all about completing the race in the highest possible position. The further up field you finish, the more points awarded. This mode is more of a simulation where clipping too many corners and colliding with opponents vehicles will drastically affect the handling of your kart. Arcade has a few nice additional touches. You begin the season with three 'lives'. Complete each race inside the top three and you will progress onto the next race. Fail and a life is lost. In Arcade mode you initially begin each race with 3 Turbos and 3 Supergrips which can be activated at any point in the race.</desc>

Conhecidos como Organização, eles desejam usar os lutadores Toshinden como sacrifícios de sangue por um ritual para convocar seu deus obscuro. Dos 15 personagens criados do Toshiden 2, agra são 32 personagens neste novo Toshiden! Destes, 14 são lutadores iniciantes, 14 membros da Organização e 4 chefes. Embora muitos dos membros da Organização tenham listas de movimentos próximas ou idênticas ao seu personagem anterior. O jogo do Toshinden 3 é uma saída radical dos jogos anteriores da série. As arenas foram redesenhadas para que elas estejam agora fechadas, permitindo a possibilidade de mandar o oponente voando para uma parede ou o teto, embora o adversário possa se recuperar e usar a parede para um contra-ataque. O sistema combinado foi novamente redesenhado; Agora, cada personagem possui um intervalo predefinido de combo, no entanto, múltiplos combos e movimentos especiais agora podem ser combinados para fazer movimentos em série com o adversário, embora mais uma vez o oponente possa recuperar e contrariar seu combo. A física do jogo foi bastante relaxada para acomodar as novas arenas e jogos; Muitos ataques lançam o adversário em toda a arena. As versões U.S e E.U do Toshinden 3 apresentam um bloqueio ligeiramente diferente configurado em relação a versão japonesa. Na versão japonesa, existem blocos separados e baixos, enquanto que na versão U.S e E.U, o bloco alto foi alterado para ser um bloco de propósito geral e bloqueará tanto alta quanto baixa automaticamente. Esta pequena mudança tem um impacto notável nas peças do jogo. As versões U.S e E.U do Toshinden 3 também apresentam novas vozes em inglês para vários personagens e alguns novos modos de jogo; um modo de prática abrangente e um modo de Sobrevivência.</desc>

		<desc>Clock Tower II: The Struggle Within, released in Japan as Clock Tower Ghost Head, was released in 1998 for the PlayStation. While sharing the gameplay mechanics of the first two, the game could be considered a spin-off from the main series. The story follows 17-year-old Alyssa Hale who suffers from multiple personality disorder with an alter ego named Mr. Bates. It received overwhelmingly poor reviews, with critics citing the disjointed story and trial-and-error gameplay.</desc>

To find them, you have to shoot your way through hordes of monsters. The game has six stages which can be taken on in any order. Each stage consists of four acts. The levels range from dark forests to deep caves, ancient crypts and underwater labyrinths. You move through the 3D levels on a predetermined path and shoot at skeletons, zombies, spiders, demons and other foul beasts. Your standard weapon is a shotgun, but you can gain additional weapons like gatling guns and grenade throwers. Some enemies throw projectiles like knives or bones at you, so be sure to aim at those as well. If the screen becomes too crowded, clear it with a smartbomb. At the end of some acts, you can choose from one of two paths through the next act, giving you different ways of completing a stage. At the end of each stage, a boss enemy awaits.</desc>

		<desc>Since 3095, the Earth Empire has spread throughout the universe, taking what it wants and destroying the rest - all in the name of sustaining life on Earth. To the Empire, expansion is of the utmost importance, even above famine, drought and death. The League of Free Worlds exists to offer resistance and hope to the plundered outlying colonies. After a key victory, it is shown that the Empire's Navy can be harmed and the ranks of the League begin to swell. Colony Wars is a combat fighter game set in space. You, as the player, join as a recruit in the League's fleet. Missions take place in various fighters, from a 1st person view inside the cockpit, or a 3rd person view from behind your ship. Ships have separate meters for shields and armor, and the player must cycle between weapons designed specifically to damage each. At the most basic, purple lasers must drain a target's shields, followed by switching to red lasers to destroy them. The game features advanced lighting and particle effects for the Playstation, as well as a basic simulation of Newtonian physics. Thrusters are only active for as long as the accelerate button is held down. The player can burst fire their thrusters and drift, allowing for some advanced maneuvers. The campaign also features multiple endings and branching missions/storylines, based on your performance in the previous operations.</desc>

		<path>./Assault Rigs (USA).chd</path>
		<name>Assault Rigs</name>
		<desc>In the future, physical sports will be replaced by a violent virtual contest, where a lot of gambling and corporate cash is involved. Such is the setting for this action-packed game, where you act as a jockey for a virtual tank of massive firepower, called a Rig. Navigate through the maze-like arenas with jumps, elevators and movable blocks. Pick up power-ups to overcome other Rigs, or Gems to advance through more than 40 levels. Graphics and ambiance are inspired, it seems, by Tron, and place the player in a "wire framed" virtual environment. The focus here, though, is not racing, but rather blowing your opponent to oblivion. For that purpose the game gives the player progressively more power and versatility. Mini guns, laser cannons and heat seeking missiles are pretty much standard gear, but it also has a couple of twists of its own: feed your guns bouncing or shattering ammo rounds for added firepower, or experiment with the fly-by-wire missiles, where you remote control it to your target of preference. Shields and turrets are also at your disposal. Also, as the game progresses, you can choose different tanks (Rigs) to use in your struggle to survive the clash. The game features 3-D graphics with light sourcing and multiplayer features.</desc>

Though it ended the war, Admiral Zemeckis of Norgard had other plans up his sleeve... In the following year of 215, he assassinated King Henguist, Almekia's widely loved ruler. With the fallen king lying at his feet, Zemeckis proclaimed himself the new emperor and began a dynasty of terror. With a lust of hate in his eyes, the new ruler named his conquered land as the Esgares Empire and unleashed brutal assaults on the neighboring countries located in Forsena. Zemeckis didn't account for the Knights of the Rune, however. Born with magical runic abilities, these warriors are looking to police Forsena from the evil tyrant's wrath. And although it will be an uphill battle against armies of monsters and elite warriors, the knights have vowed to succeed!</desc>

		<name>David Beckham Soccer</name>
		<desc>Endorsed by the then England and Manchester United captain and international superstar, David Beckham Soccer is the last of Rage long tradition in developing soccer games. It includes both national and club teams (from England, France, Germany, Italy and Spain), plus the ability to create custom teams, with details ranging from the usual name, strips and colours to the stadium. Other than Beckham himself, no player is licensed (likeness is preserved, but names are replaced with phonetic equivalents, such as “Owin” or “Zanetee”), but the editor also allows the player to customize each player and team. Game modes include friendly, club season, several international cups (including the defunct Home Championship), Classic Matches (some featuring the highlights of Beckham's career, others just classic matches), Beat Brazil, where the player starts with France, and tries to beat Brazil with a progressively weaker team, Survival, where the player face top international teams, with goals against carrying over, until the player loses a match, and Train With Beckham, a series of drill minigames destined to teach the basics of the game and unlock “secrets”. Gameplay is similar to previous titles developed by the company (most notably Microsoft Football 2000 and UEFA Striker), and not unlike Beckham, has its strong point during dead ball situations, where the player can choose either to use a set play to get the defense offguard, or take a direct shot or swerving pass using the traditional arrow indicator. In terms of options, the game doesn’t offer much to tweak, only bookings, offsides, injuries, match length and the decider (simple or golden goal overtime and penalty shootout)</desc>

In a futuristic setting, players take the well-armed role of the title character, who battles against the forces of a genetic engineering organization gone wrong. Enemies are varied, some deadly powerful, others agile, and difficult to hit. The game is completely 3D-rendered, and it is possible to aim up and down as well as left and right. Large, complex levels pose labyrinthine challenges, as well as the powerful bosses that wait secured in their deepest chambers. The game is set apart from contemporary first-person shooters by a crouch ability, which allows the lead character to crawl through ducts and other short spaces. The character can also run, strafe, and jump, for full-motion 3D shooter play. Features: * Upgrade your gun with mods found throughout each level * Navigate Tenka through a variety of environments to stop the genetic experiments * Use laser sighting to find your enemy and take him out in the light or in the dark</desc>

The control system of selecting units with the mouse and then directing them is similar to future titles such as Total Annihilation. The game focuses on a war between two organizations, The Brotherhood of Nod and the Global Defense Initiative. You can take control of either side for more than 15 missions. Both have different units and structures, including artillery, tanks and light infantry. In most missions you have to build a base first to build new units and structures. Most important are the special harvesters, which collect Tiberium and deliver it to a refinery, where it's converted into money - money which is needed to create additional units. The game also features FMV mission briefings and victory cutscenes.</desc>

		<desc>In the value-priced Crossroad Crisis, it's up to you to protect a wandering baby chick stranded in a maze of red, green and blue tiles. By moving and rotating the tiles, you can create a safe path for the chick to walk on. But in order to complete each of the game's ten stages, you must first clear the required number of tiles from the board. Tiles are cleared by linking two or more of the same color and having the chick walk over them. Once the target number has been cleared, the exit appears and you can lead the chick to the next stage. The number of cleared tiles necessary to reveal the exit increases as the game progresses. Each time the chick walks off the edge of a tile, a life is lost and the board is reset. In addition to the ten stages of Clear mode, Vs. mode pits the chick against a duck in a two-player battle to clear tiles and lead your animal to safety first. Beginner mode contains three stages and a lesson on how to play.</desc>

		<desc>This Castlevania game was originally released on the Sharp X68000 (a home computer relatively unknown outside of Japan) but never made it to the worldwide audience. This conversion is meant to fix that, a remake of the original for the PlayStation with a good deal of new features. This game plays very much like any old platform game on the NES (specifically, it plays just like an old Castlevania), you walk slowly forward killing any demonic creature you meet. The game is mostly sideways, though you can jump or walk onto the platforms here and there. The game plays like an old game, but looks like a new one with completely remade 2D graphics, with FMV cutscenes, arranged high quality music and more.</desc>

The game features a Tournament, Arcade, and Time Trial mode.In tournament mode, players get to choose one of the 10 (8 are selectable from the start and 2 are unlockable) animal racers to race with. The tournament offers three different sets of trophy races; the cross cup, dune cup, and the rock cup. Each cup consists of 3 different racetracks; underground, red rock, and atlantis. These 3 racetracks get altered depending on what cup the player is competing for.When racing, players attempt to beat the five opponents they are up against to the finish line. To help achieve this goal, players can shoot guided rockets, use speed boosts, and lay mines to hinder their opponents. The higher the position the player gets in a race, the more points they earn. The player with the most points after all the races are done wins the championship cup.Arcade lets the player compete on any of the available tracks so they can practice racing on them. Time Trial lets the player race solo, trying to defeat a track in as little time as possible.Options include setting the difficulty level (easy or medium), setting the number of laps (3, 5, 9 or 50), and whether to turn vibration on or off.</desc>

		<desc>Block Buster (or Block Kuzushi or Simple 1500 Series vol.014 - The Block Kuzushi in Japan) is a good breakout game that can be played by 2 players in cooperative or VS mode. The game offers some interesting special moves like the one in which you can hit the ball with effect pressing a buttom. There are 3 different game modes: Attack mode, Endless mode &amp; VS mode. With roots in the classic Breakout game from a few decades ago, Block Kuzushi continues where Arkanoid left off and updates the theme with colorful jewels to hit in addition to the standard rows of bricks. During the course of play, weapon upgrades may be picked up such as multiple balls, shooting power and other brick bashing powerups. Roaming objects on-screen may deflect your ball so watch out for surprise changes in trajectory when these nuisances are afoot. 60 levels of cleverly designed boards (and some not so clever ones) should hold your attention for a few hours.</desc>

The exhibition mode lets the player pick a boxer and fight a computer boxer. The VS. mode lets two players slug it out in the boxing ring against each other. The tournament mode lets the player compete in a tournament. The Main Event mode lets the player pick one of eight different boxers, each with their own set of skills (life, power, speed and endurance), and work their way through the ranks (Local, National and World) by defeating 40 different boxers in order to win the World Championship. If the player is good enough to actually win the World Championship, they then have to defend their belt against numerous challengers. Players can improve their skills by winning matches and training between matches by sparring with their trainer. Advancing through this mode also unlocks boxers for the exhibition mode. In the ring, each boxer can throw punches like jabs, upper-cuts, hooks, and crosses, and is also able to duck and weave and block high and low while on defense.</desc>

Flying through the sky on their sandflier, Nina and Cray are attacked by a worm shaped dragon. With their vehicle damaged, Nina returns to the city to find parts, bumping into a naked young boy named Ryu along the way, who is unsure of where he is. At the very same time, Nina is again attacked by a dragon. Confused by the strange events taking place, Nina agrees to help the young boy. Meanwhile, the ancient Emperor Fou Lu awakens from his slumber in his tomb. His plan is to return to the world of human, conquer it anew, and impose his iron rule on it... This fourth installment of the Breath of Fire series is a fairly traditional Japanese-style RPG, with turn-based combat, party management, linear story progression, and other characteristic elements of the genre. As in the previous game, characters become stronger and learn new skills by performing tasks for "masters" living in different towns. Ryu, the main protagonist of the series, has retained the series' trademark gameplay element: the ability to turn into a dragon during combat. Breath of Fire IV is rich in mini-games of various types, including the popular fishing mini-game that was present in previous installments as well.</desc>

Luckily, there are potions that will change him into a turtle, rabbit, or some other creature. For those who enjoyed the film, actual movie clips and voice work from David Spade help the game look and sound like the movie. All of the action and excitement of the Disney film comes home in The Emperor's New Groove.</desc>

		<name>BattleTanx : Global Assault</name>
		<desc>BattleTanx: Global Assault makes its PlayStation debut with more levels than the earlier Nintendo 64 version. Split-screen multiplayer support is also included, but for two players instead of four. The fast-paced action involves motoring across grid-like environments in one of 13 well-outfitted tanks. Solo players can complete 40 search-and-destroy missions in the campaign mode, while up to two friends can blast each other to scrap metal in seven deathmatch, capture-the-flag, and tag variants. Twenty power-ups are available in total, ranging from cloaking and teleporting devices to plasma bolts and guided missiles. Featured levels take place in futuristic versions of San Francisco, Washington, London, Paris, and Berlin, all of which are home to ruthless, tank-driving gangs. Prior to the game's beginning, Griffin Spade set about reclaiming his lost love and establishing his tribe in San Francisco. But the peace he'd blasted out for himself looks to be short-lived as he's having frequent nightmares about a sinister QueenLord. It's up to Griffin to mount up again and with all the finesse that a giant tank can muster and solve the mystery behind this evil woman. And so the stage is set for Battle Tanx: Global Assault.</desc>

		<name>Battle Arena Toshinden 2</name>
		<desc>Himitsu Kessha founded the Toshinden--held annually, these tournaments feature strong combatants from all around the world. After the established corporation found out a nonsanctioned tournament was held by Gaia, they began organizing another Toshinden; their motivations are to lure the rebel to the tournament and have him slain for his insolence. Thus is the premise behind Battle Arena Toshinden 2, the sequel to the PlayStation's first rotational, 360-degree 3D fighting game. Featuring characters from the original, there are eleven fighters in all, including Eiji Shinjo, Kayin Amoh, Tracy, Chaos, and Duke B. Rambert; characters feature their own arenas, moves, combinations, weapons, and special attacks. Additionally, there is a mysterious bonus character waiting to be unlocked and two bosses to fight. There are a few game play options including the one player, full battle, and versus modes. Whereas the one player mode will have you battling against eight computer-controlled opponents, the full battle option throws you into a heated tournament of 10 characters--not including the bosses. The versus mode is selectable at any time, as long as you have access to a secondary controller; here you'll fight against a human opponent.</desc>

		<desc>Bomberman Wars is a video game in the Bomberman series released for the Sega Saturn and PlayStation in April 16, 1998. It is the third Bomberman game for the Saturn, and the second for the PlayStation. Both versions were released only in Japan. Bombermanis like a Technicolor Pac Man with high-pitched, shrieking kamikaze kid voices and sackloads of bombs. You're stuck in a maze with other cute fellas with the same taste. Using your limitless supply of bombs, you just gotta blast eem. With all sorts of tasty options and 101 different bonuses, killing has never been this sweet... The game got a story mode in which the player controls a king and his knights and they got to defend their kingdom from the different enemies. The missions are most complicated as the player advance in the game. The gameplay is the usual in a tactical rpg, the player characters and the enemies got a limited range of movement for each turn and when they are near an enemy they can make the different attacks.</desc>

		<desc>This game is a port of the Arcade game of the same name and was released only in Japan. The game's premises differ somewhat by most of its brethren: the player assumes the role of a pilot whose mission is to actually survive an eight years long training mission, where he/she is supposed to prove his/her worth as a fighter and gain entry to the future elite squadron known as the DonPachi Squadron - which is featured prominently throughout the entire series. The twist lies in the fact that the enemies are, in truth, the player's very own comrades, posing as enemies and sacrificing their lives for the sake of allowing only the most skilled pilots to pass the test, and survive. The player flies their selected fighter over 5 areas of various terrain, encountering a number of land, sea and air enemies. The player's ship has two modes of fire: by tapping the fire button, shots are fired; holding it down produces a concentrated vertical beam, but also reduces the ship's speed.</desc>

Chaos Break's story begins when the evil Fluxus Inc... bio-engineers 'monsters' from living cells found in a meteorite, which spontaneously propagate on an island facility in Chilean territory. This propagation must obviously be stopped by the forces of good. A woman with a beret named 'Mitsuki', and her red-headed male friend named Rick, must killing zombies. When Mitsuki and friends helicopter down to the island over an ugly backdrop of the least convincingly animated water I have ever seen, they are attacked by mutants and then they have to run around finding keys and passwords to open doors, treading on the odd squirming yellow monster and wiping that fresh alien crud from their boots.</desc>

		<desc>In this game, players are put into the role of a submersible to explore the ocean depths at their leisure. Along the way, players can cruise the depths of the ocean from a first-person perspective, climbing or diving the waters as they see fit to discover the wonders of the ocean. Along the way, players can locate sunken ships, statues, and other aquatic treasures, or attempt to communicate with the various sea life through sonar, whether it's a whale, or one of the more bizarre creatures found within the darkest depths of the ocean.Players can also leave underwater stations to mark points of interest for future study, or even assist in building a customizable coral reef that will continue to grow and attract marine life.Aquanaut's Holiday focuses on the subtleties of discovery over fast-paced action sequences or point accumulation.</desc>

		<desc>Comprising three titles, (Buster Bros., Super Buster Bros., and Buster Buddies), Buster Bros. Collection is a compilation of Capcom's "Buster" arcade series -- released over a period of six years from 1989 to 1995. Gameplay presents a blend of puzzle and action that sees players strafing from side-to-side, shooting vertically at the bubbles that bounce around the arena. Enclosed within the confines of a single, 2D arena, one or two players must utilize their rope-gun devices to destroy the deluge of bubbles that inundate the screen. When hit, the bubbles burst into multiple, smaller segments, and will continue to do so until the smallest bubble is destroyed. Only by clearing the screen can players proceed. However, coming into contact with a bubble will result in the immediate loss of a life.</desc>

		<desc>Inspector Gadget: Gadget's Crazy Maze isn't the type of game one would expect when taking on the role of the bumbling, multi-functional detective of the 1980's cartoon. Rather than an action title like its Game Boy Color counterpart, this incarnation of Inspector Gadget is best described as a puzzle game with limited action elements. According to the story of Gadget's Crazy Maze, Inspector Gadget's mysterious arch-nemesis is up to no good once again. This time, the MADD ringleader Dr. Claw has been creating mind-control crystals on his secret moon base, then tossing them down to Earth. If the crystals lay dormant for a short amount of time, they will activate, taking control of the consciousness of the whole world. To make sure no one disturbs them, Dr. Claw has spread them all around four different areas and inserted his vile henchmen to protect them.</desc>

Quando os mineradores decidem explodir uma grande pedra de chrys utilizando dinamites, um bebê dragão preservado, porém desgastado e confuso pelos séculos de hibernação emerge rapidamente e ataca os mineiros que entram em pânico, até ser nocauteado e colocado a bordo de um trem para ser levado e ser estudado. Na saída da mina, o dragão se lança com sua gaiola para fora do trem, descendo pela colina e cai nos arredores de uma grande floresta, onde se transforma em um menino antes de voltar a perder a consciência. Algum tempo depois, ele é encontrado por Rei, um ladrão, membro da tribo Woren dos homens-tigres e por um órfão que o acompanhava e acredita que eles estão lidando com apenas mais uma criança abandonada.</desc>

Only then will you have the power of the mighty Orb at your disposal to use as the ultimate weapon against Draak. By the numbers, Darkstone contains four distinct regions of Uma, more than 100 evil creatures based on 30 types of characters, 32 specific spells and nearly two dozen skills (six major).

One day, Mog discovers a new Mysterious Dungeon and takes the treasure from inside. This releases a seal which causes the Bahamut to appear just as the dungeons plunges into the ocean. Chocobo is rescued by a young white mage, Shiroma, who is the only human living in the monster village. Chocobo must help Mog, find Bahamut and fix whatever has been unsealed from the Mysterious Dungeon. Chocobo's Dungeon 2 is a simple action / rpg in the style of other games in the Mysterious Dungeon series. Chocobo must decend into dungeon areas alone or with a partner (controlled by the cpu or the second player), gathering treasure, while finding the passageway to the next floor and satisfying hunger. The game is viewed from the top down as all objects on the screen move at the same time. Chocobo can equip a single weapon and armor item, while the hunger level is satisfied by eating different forms of nuts. Spells can be collected, while successive casting increases the proficiency in that spell. Unlike other Mysterious Dungeon games, Chocobo keeps his level and stats between trips to the dungeon. Boss monsters wait at the completion of most objectives. Different subquests are available from the residents of Monster Town.</desc>

		<desc>Digimon Rumble Arena is a family-friendly fighting game offering single- and two-player modes. You can battle as or against your favorite digital monsters, both past and present. Power-ups give Digimon characters defining special abilities that can make a difference in close contests and platform traps like conveyor belts and falling icicles are part of the mix. In single-player mode, you compete against the computer by clearing stages and advancing through all 20 characters. Six environments include Sanctuary (lightening bolts), Wilderness (boulders), Garbage Recycling Center (compactor), Revolution (rotating screen), Glacier (icicles), and Volcano, with a few mini-games thrown in for fun. Two-player action lets you compete against another human, while the Versus Computer mode offers single matches against the computer where you pick the level and character to fight. Each Digimon has special moves, such as Wormon's sticky net, Stingmon's moon shooter, and MegaGargomon's bum rush, and gaining enough energy allows them to "digivolve" into more powerful versions for a limited amount of time. Special items featuring positive and negative effects appear sporadically during the fighting and affect gameplay: digi plus, digi minus, max and forced digivolve, power down, queen device, evil ring and spiral bomb, and fire, water, and wind attacks. Features: Campaign, two-player, and single-match fighting modes Twenty characters from all three seasons of Digimon: Digital Monsters Six arenas, power ups, and special moves Mini-games during Single Player combat</desc>

After awakening from a deep sleep, you realize you are no longer flying through the Earth's blue skies--you're not even human! Aliens have infected your blood with their DNA to get you to fight on their side. These aliens, referred to as Reptons, are locked in a bitter struggle against the Ovons to decide the fate of their galaxy. Since the Reptons desperately need your skills, they have been kind enough to genetically fuse your body with one of their ships. Darklight Conflict lets you fly over 50 single player missions to rid the galaxy of the dreaded Ovons. Missions range from dogfights, bombing runs, defending ships, as well as rescue and intelligence operations. Real-time lens flares and light sourcing will make the battles come alive, while 14 different weapons prepare you for whatever the enemy has in store. Throughout your adventure you'll have the opportunity to pilot different ships, some of which include bombers, gunships and fighters. Perhaps you'll be sent back home if you're successful...</desc>

In this dark future, one-on-one Tank Duels (to the death) are the spectator sport of choice, and you are a contestant. You can choose between six different tanks, each of them varying in speed, shield strength, weapon power, and maneuverability. Once you have chosen your tank, you must drive it around an obstacle-ridden, flat-surfaced arena, hiding behind barriers, and shooting your machine guns and heat-seeking missiles at an opposing tank. You can play against the computer or challenge a friend in head-to-head split-screen action. In the one-player mode, if you destroy the enemy tank, you win the round and advance to the next stage. If your tank loses all of its shield strength, the computer wins and the game is over. If you're playing with the timer on, the tank with the highest level of shield strength when the time runs out wins the battle.</desc>

Set in an apocalyptic future, the freaks have the ability to fight with combos and fire machine guns and missile launchers. The block action can also elicit a full body shield that protects you from bullets and other projectiles. A nice twist in Bio F.R.E.A.K.S is that you can fight on land and in the air with the typical Mortal Kombat/SteetFighter button combinations (two punch, two kick) while implementing two side step buttons and a fire button (for your weapon). The huge, lethal (a flame pit, lava, and giant rollers) environments allow for full 3D movement either in the air or on the ground. Bio F.R.E.A.K.S also offers an option to 'turn-off' the gore and blood, and options to turn off the shield, flight, and fire capabilities for a more traditional fighting game. Beyond the arcade mode, Bio F.R.E.A.K.S also offers a survival, team, versus, and practice mode for more replay value!</desc>

This system gives players the play-it-again variety that will have them wanting to play Crisis Beat again and again. When you can't make the grade on your own you can call on a friend to help in two player mode.

		<name>Ninpuu Sentai Hurricanger</name>
		<desc>Ninpu Sentai Harikenger is based on the popular Japanese Sentai of the same name. Also it was known in the U.S. as Power Rangers Ninja Storm. Is the sequel to Hyakujuu Sentai GaoRanger. You start out with just a Story mode and a 1 on 1 fighting mode. As you progress, however, many more modes become available. The in-game action is fairly the same as Hyakujuu Sentai GaoRanger's, except that now you have Street-Fighter style special moves you can do in addition to the normal punches and kicks. In GaoRanger you were limited to just GaoRed. In Harikenger you can select from the Red, Blue, or Yellow Harikengers, and in certain stages the Kabutoraijer, Kuwagataraijer, Shurikenger, and, in a special mode, another ranger from a previous series. Once you were done with GaoRanger's story mode all you really had was a survival mode. In Harikenger you get that and so much more.</desc>

		<desc>The toy room has been abuzz with a new contest: Andy has obtained a plethora of radio-controlled vehicles; Buzz Lightyear, Woody and the rest of the gang have found these little cars to be perfect for racing! These fearless animated characters have ignored potential danger and taken to their own environment, even venturing to a hazardous street and the perilous Pizza Planet in a heated competition to find out which toy is the best driver. Released for the PlayStation, Disney/Pixar's Toy Story Racer is a go-kart racing title that endeavors to bring the action and environments from the animated classic to said console. Natural for the genre, the various vehicles, characters and power-ups are not realistic nor attempt to be; instead, these things are arcade-like in nature and used in the tradition of Mario Kart. Armchair kart fans will race through 18 courses and have access to various modes. Completion of these modes will unlock a plethora of secrets.</desc>

		<name>Descent</name>
		<desc>The Post-Terran Minerals Corporation (PTMC) digs up minerals on all nine planets of the solar system, employing humans and robots to do its job. Unfortunately, the mining robots are now being controlled by a hacker, and have taken the human workers hostage. The PTMC has tried to get the robots back under their control, but communication with the mining stations has been lost. In desperation, the PTMC modifies a Pyro-GX ship for combat and hires a mercenary, codenamed "Material Defender", to fly it. The mission is to destroy the infected mines and rescue human hostages, destroying any hostile robot that gets in the way. Descent is a 3D first-person game that puts the player at the controls of the Pyro-GX spaceship. Descent is notable in that the player travels through various interior locations (mines) but can do so in 720 degrees of movement. The ship however only moves forward and backward in any of the directions it is facing. The ship is able to use a variety of weapons scattered as power-ups throughout each level. They include: standard lasers, the Vulcan Cannon (a chaingun-like weapon), the Spreadfire Cannon (a rapidly firing, shotgun-like energy weapon), the Plasma Cannon (a rapidly firing energy weapon more suited for medium-range combat), and the Fusion Cannon (fires a ball of energy that's more powerful the longer it is charged it up, but could destroy the ship). All of these weapons, except for the Vulcan Cannon, use the ship's energy supply. The Pyro-PX is also capable of firing regular concussion missiles, homing missiles, proximity bombs (sits in the sky, then explodes when something gets close to it), smart missiles (more powerful homing missiles that fire out homing energy balls upon impact with their target), and Mega Missiles (the ultimate weapons of mass destruction). The goal of each level is to locate and destroy the mine's reactor. Once completed, there are only 45 seconds to find the escape hatch to get out of the mine before it explodes. As progress is made through the game, the AI will adapt to player's strategies and attempt to prevent the player from reaching the goals.</desc>

		<desc>Bubble Bobble is an arcade game by Taito, first released in 1986 and later ported to numerous home computers and game consoles. The game, starring the twin Bubble Dragons Bub and Bob, is an action-platform game in which players travel through one hundred different stages, blowing and bursting bubbles, avoiding enemies and collecting a variety of items. The game became very popular and led to a long series of sequels and spin-offs. The main goal of the game is to rescue Bub and Bob's girlfriends from big wind-up toasters, among other enemies. It is also notable for being an early example of a game with multiple endings, which depended on the player's skill and discovering secrets. One or two players attempt to save their friends in this re-release of the 1987 classic puzzle/action game. Players blow bubbles to trap enemies. When they pop the bubbles, fruit comes out and the players compete for the points. If they don't pop the bubbles in time, the enemies escape and become faster.</desc>

		<name>Cowboy Bebop</name>
		<desc>Cowboy Bebop is a Japanese anime series. Directed by Shinichiro Watanabe and written by Keiko Nobumoto, the series was produced by Sunrise in the late 1990s. Its 26 episodes comprise a complete storyline: the series, set in 2071, follows the misadventures and tragedies of a group of bounty hunters, or "cowboys", traveling on their spaceship, the Bebop. Plot: The crew of the spaceship Bebop are a partnership of bounty hunters, called "cowboys", who travel the solar system trying to apprehend bounties. Jet Black is the owner of the Bebop, but has partnered with Spike for his diverse combat skills. Though he is reluctant to admit it, Jet has also come to rely on Spike for companionship in the normally solitary field of bounty hunting. In 2022, the explosion of an experimental warp gateway caused major damage to the Moon and the Earth, killing nearly all life and effectively ending Earth civilization. As a result, the survivors abandoned the now-uninhabitable Earth to colonize the inner planets and moons of Jupiter. Little to no knowledge remains of the history of Earth and humanity prior to the accident, creating a cultural void. In the show's timeline, decades after the accident, the entire solar system has been made accessible via reliable warp gates, but the crew of the Bebop regularly spends much of their time on Mars, the new central hub of human civilization.</desc>

Simple, but effective! Moorhuhn X again contains some hidden highlights for the players to discover, but the main issue is the number of grouse you manage to hit. The grouse fly across the landscape, and are knocked down with well-aimed salvos from the hunter's gun as often possible in 90 seconds. Other than that, there's a new design, an altered grouse, new puzzles, new characters and much, much more.</desc>

		<name>Whizz</name>
		<desc>Whizz is one of the few 3D platformers to use an isometric viewpoint. The controls reflect this, with moving the controller to the right actually moving the character down and right, moving it down and right moving the character down directly, and so on. Each level is played out against a time limit, and the paths through the level aren’t always clear-cut. There are four different types of doors, each of which needs a particular icon to pass (the icons represent the door type, such as ice or bricks, rather than hot water or a key, or anything you’d logically expect to clear the path). You can avoid the baddies, which may be the best option, as killing them costs you some energy –this reduces the significance of the points system.</desc>

Platformers and shooters are the program's strengths although clever designers will be able to program more complicated offerings.

		<name>Ballistic</name>
		<desc>Ballistic começou a vida como um jogo de arcade chamado Time Loop e apresenta elementos reminiscentes de Bust-A-Move e Battle Balls, embora com um estilo decididamente único de jogabilidade. O objetivo principal é impedir que as bolas cheguem ao portão central, mas, em vez de mirar em bolas que caem do topo da tela, você atira nelas a partir de um canhão central à medida que elas se movem em espiral. A chave é criar várias reações em cadeia para receber mais pontos. O objeto em Panic (um dos três modos) é estender a jogabilidade o maior tempo possível e construir a pontuação mais alta, eliminando mais e mais bolas. A velocidade aumenta à medida que você destrói todas as bolas em cada corda, e a cada dez níveis um foguete se materializa, o que empurra as bolas em direção ao portão central. Destruir o foguete aumenta ainda mais a velocidade, mas bombas podem ser usadas para eliminar todas as bolas na tela da mesma cor. O modo Stage permite limpar uma sequência finita de bolas numa base de nível para nível, mas, ao contrário do modo Panic, a jogabilidade é interrompida após a conclusão de cada nível. Você recebe os mesmos power-ups de bombas, mas os twisters desviam seus tiros, os relógios congelam a corrente, e as bolas e baús ocos guardam surpresas escondidas.nn</desc>

		<desc>.... Over a 1000 years ago when the Strega suddenly appeared in Zamu'el, a small country located on the edge of the continent. These Strega possessed mysterious powers, and so they were revered and respected by the men and women of Zamu'el. Aside from their mysterious powers, the Strega also possessed knowledge far more advanced than that of Zamu'el, in such fields as metallurgy and agriculture. The Strega gladly passed this knowledge on to the inhabitants of Zamu'el, transforming the once poor country into a prosperous nation. Furthermore, the Strega, in their kindness, created objects that would allow normal humans to control powers similar to their own and bestowed them upon the people. Many of these objects, called Jeno at the time, were made and presented to the populace of Zamu'el. As the people learned to use the Jeno, they began to extend their borders into neighboring lands. With their new powers, they felt invincible, and failed to listen to the warning of the Strega whom they had once revered as gods. In just a short 10 years, Zamu'el had conquered the entire continent. However, even as they destroyed the last of their enemies, their mighty Empire began to crumble. Greedy, ambitious men rebelled throughout the land - each rebellion fought by Jeno bearers. The Jeno War, as it was eventually called, unleashed unimaginable destruction upon the land and its people. The very continent they had fought to win, was nothing more than a wasteland of disease and death by the time the fighting ended. In addition, the devastating power of the Jeno vanished, making the objects nothing more than fancy trinkets.</desc>

		<name>Darkstalkers : The Night Warriors</name>
		<desc>Darkstalkers, conhecido no Japão como Vampire, é uma série de jogos de luta 2D desenvolvidos e publicados pela Capcom, começando com Darkstalkers: The Night Warriors (Vampire: The Night Warriors) em 1994. A série é ambientada em um universo de terror gótico e apresenta um estilo gráfico de desenho animado altamente estilizado. O Jogo apresenta personagens baseados em vários tipos de monstros (os "darkstalkers" titulares) ou em seus caçadores, todos envolvidos em combate uns contra os outros. Darkstalkers introduziu muitos dos conceitos usados em jogos de luta posteriores da Capcom, incluindo o seu primeiro uso de sprites de animação colorida de 16 bits e mecânica de jogo mais tarde empregada nas séries Street Fighter Alpha e Marvel vs. Capcom.</desc>

		<desc>Aliens have infested the earth once more, and all is lost unless you step into the fray and take action against these otherworldly inhabitants. Contra: Legacy of War is a continuation of the long-running saga that started back on the Nintendo Entertainment System where a lone solider, with the choice of a partner (two-player mode) is faced with the pending threat of a total world domination by galactic creatures. You must battle your way level through hellish level in order to reach the final confrontation with the supreme entity. You wont be unprepared, however. There are numerous weapons and power-ups at your disposal, so, choose wisely soldier, the world is counting on you. Blast through six levels of running, jumping, and shooting action. Along the way, use classic CONTRA weapons like the spread gun, and few new ones, like the powerful flame-thrower and homing rounds. CONTRA gets a new look with 3D environments and character models. To make the action pop out of the screen, put on the special glasses included in the package and play in the 3D mode.</desc>

		<desc>Cyberbots: Fullmetal Madness is a fighting game produced by Capcom in 1994 where the pilots of mecha battle each other. The mecha, officially known as "Variant Armors", in this game are the same ones featured in the fighting action game Armored Warriors. It was ported to the Sega Saturn and the Sony PlayStation. The game only saw limited distribution in arcades outside of Japan, and none of the console ports were released overseas. Tech Romancer (produced by Capcom and ported to the Sega Dreamcast) is considered a spiritual sequel for this game, Jin and BX-02 Blodia are present in the game as an unlockable bonus character/mecha. Plot: In the game the player first chooses the pilot and then the mech (Valiant/Variant Armor or VA for short) they'll use to fight. The mechs determine the gameplay of the game, but the pilot is what determines the storyline the player will see. Near the end of the 21st century Earth begins to become over populated leading to many people living in man made space colonies. The primary army of Earth, "Earth Force", has been conducting experiments and their work, along with the actions of the playable characters will determine the future of Earth.</desc>

Crash se junta a sua amada Coco, o malvado Cortex e uma combinação de amigos animais e chefões malvados de jogos anteriores, cada um com seus atributos de velocidade, aceleração e manobrabilidade. Os Cinco modos de jogo incluem Aventura, Time Trial e Batalha. O modo Aventura(principal do jogo) envolve a tentativa de derrotar o alienígena chamado Nitrous Oxide em um torneio com 16 corridas. Os jogadores começam a aventura tropical escolhendo entre um dos oito personagens: Crash Bandicoot, Dr. Neo Cortex, Coco Bandicoot, Dr. N. Gin, Pura, Polar e Dingodile. Adicionalmente a aceleração e frenagem, os karts podem executar uma gama de técnicas para fazer a corrida mais competitiva para jogadores habilidosos. Power-sildes podem ser utilizados para curvas forçadas, e os jogadores podem maximizar a velocidade de seus veículos ao passar por cima de dez peças de frutas. As pistas também possuem diversas rampas para propelir os karts pelos ares e os jogadores tem a possibilidade de passar sobre itens que estão no chão. O "Hang Time Meter" ajuda os jogadores a mensurar quanto tempo um veículo permanece no ar; Quanto mais tempo estiver, maior é o bônus de turbo ao aterrizar. Um jogo de kart não seria completo sem power-ups, e o CTR possui 11 itens diferentes para serem utilizados durante o jogo, incluindo mísseis teleguiados, caixas explosivas, bombas bola de boliche e medidas defensivas como máscaras Aku Aku. Cada power-up pode ser incrementado coletando frutas. O Objetivo do modo Aventura é derrotar todos os oponentes através da sequência de corridas. Ao fazer isto, os jogadores adquirem troféus, que os auxiliam a acessar novas pistas. Jogadores também são livres para repetir corridas para novos prêmios que incluem Relíquias, CTR Tokens e Gemas. Relíquias são ganhas ao atingir certos tempos de voltas, três tokens CTR estão escondidos em cada pista e Gemas especiais são ganhas ao vencedor de cada um dos cinco torneios "Gem Cup".</desc>

		<name>Worms World Party</name>
		<desc>Worms World Party is an artillery game, which is a type of Turn-based strategy game. Like its predecessors, Worms World Party involves controlling a team of worms and using a collection of weaponry to eliminate the opposing team(s). The worms can walk and jump around and use tools such as the ninja rope and parachute to move to otherwise unreachable locations. The worms have an arsenal of dozens of weapons, ranging from longbows to bazookas and from fireball to Holy Hand Grenades. There are also an array of special weapons, such as Armageddon (meteor shower) or the end-all, be-all Concrete Donkey. Some of these weapons are present in the worms' initial arsenal while others can be collected from randomly appearing crates during the game. For some weapons, such as grenades, holding the launching key longer shoots them further. The landscape can be deformed with any weapon, forcing the players to adapt to changing environments. Also, in addition to the nature-made obstacles, the maps may contain land mines which explode when a worm comes close to one, and barrels which explode when shot, spreading out some burning napalm. These often lead to fancy combinations where, for example, a worm is first hit with a grenade and is then thrown against a mine which sets off another worm, which hits a third worm who slips into the water.</desc>

Toc-Man and his ghosts have kidnapped Pac-Man's friends, Ms. Pac-Man, Pac Jr., Baby Pac, Professor Pac, Pooka, and Chomp-Chomp the dog! Pac-Man must venture to Toc-Man's lair on Ghost Island to rescue his friends! Hidden through this side-scrolling, 3D adventure game, Pac-Man faces challenging puzzles and games that have appeared in Pac-Man's previous games. Many things in this game are a tribute to original games and even Inky, Blinky, Pinky, and Clyde are back for another chance to get Pac-Man. There are several kinds of gameplay modes available. The newest is Quest mode. Pac-Man can maneuver up/down and left/right on the screen, but the camera is fixed on the side and scrolls along as Pac-Man searches through all the stages of Ghost Island. The player must collect Pac-Dots, Fruit, Keys, etc to advance through the level all the while defeating ghosts (by bouncing on them) and solving puzzles. An adventure game, the story progresses as the levels do with switches to be found and chests to be opened. There is also a scoring system that encourages the player to collect as much as possible. Make sure you have a Memory card available before starting out on Pac-Man's lengthy quest! The other two types of modes are Classic mode and Maze mode. Classic mode is a 100% faithful conversion of Pac-Man's original game. Maze Mode is the gameplay from Classic Pac-Man translated into a 3D environment.

		<desc>A few days after the events described in Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation, Lara Croft is presumed dead. Her close friends begin to recollect her previous adventures, which occurred during different periods of her life. These include searching for the Philosopher's Stone in Rome; preventing the Spear of Destiny from falling into the hands of a ruthless gang leader; facing monsters on the Black Isle of Ireland as a child; and, finally, infiltrating a high-tech complex in pursuit of the Iris artefact.

Like its predecessors, Tomb Raider: Chronicles is an action game with puzzle-solving and platforming elements. The gameplay is very similar to that of the previous games, with the addition of a few new skills. Lara can now walk on tightropes, swing on horizontal bars, and somersault forwards from a ledge while crouching. A grappling hook has been added to her inventory. The game also includes a level editor, allowing the player to create new stages for Lara to explore.</desc>

		<desc>MDK is a 3rd person action/shooter game in which the objective is to basically shoot everything that moves in six massive cities, each with their own sublevels. Because the world is being invaded by aliens, it is up to you and your sidekick Bones to stop the invasion and single handedly save Earth. In order to do so, you must make good use of your special suit, which allows you to do all kinds of things.

The super-suit comes equipped with many features you'll need to utilize in your journey, such as the sniper helmet. This allows you to zoom in on unsuspecting enemies and fire off shots with pinpoint accuracy. There is also a built in parachute (a ribbon-like device) that enables you to glide between different platforms as well as drop down on intruders.

Your suit comes equipped with a chain gun that has an infinite supply of ammunition. You can also pick up special items, like a miniature nuclear bomb and powerful upgrades for your chaingun. In addition to running around and shooting, there are also special means of transportation including a surfboard-like jet and a bomber plane that is used to call in air strikes.</desc>

The main antagonist is Doctor Neo Cortex, a mad scientist who was often ridiculed by the scientific community for his outlandish (but nearly workable) theories and is now motivated to prove his tormentors wrong by creating a mutated army of beasts to conquer the world. Cortex's henchman is Doctor Nitrus Brio, the insecure creator of the Evolvo-Ray. Crash's love interest is Tawna, a female bandicoot about to undergo experimentation by the Doctors. Helping Crash in his journey is an ancient witch doctor spirit named Aku Aku, who has scattered masks of himself throughout the islands to grant Crash special powers. The boss characters of the game include Papu Papu, the obese and short-tempered chief of the native village; Ripper Roo, a demented kangaroo with razor-sharp toenails; Koala Kong, a muscular but unintelligent koala; and Pinstripe Potoroo, the tommy gun-wielding bodyguard of Doctor Cortex.</desc>

		<desc>As Ford automobiles have won the NASCAR Winston Cup trophy more often than cars from any other manufacturer, it seems natural to create a game based on this consistent success. Empire Interactive has done just that in Ford Racing. In addition to the classic Taurus or Mustang, players may also choose to race a GT90, an Explorer, an F-Series, or one of several concept cars. In all, twelve different vehicles are available to players in Ford Racing. The game features ten racetracks and a couple of different modes of play. Single-player and multiplayer races are available, as well as a career mode. Career mode allows players to race for sponsors, improving their vehicles with a share of the prize money. With continued success and sufficient winnings, players may eventually build up enough of a financial base to sponsor their own racing teams and compete at the world-class level.</desc>

		<desc>The gameplay in Bomberman Party Edition represents something of a return to the classic Bomberman style of play. There aren't a lot of extra hoops to jump through, just a lot of things to blow up. The idea is basic; make your way around the board and explode as much stuff as you can. Of course as in the original, lots of power-ups are available to add to the excitement and bring new strategic considerations into the mix. A single-player "story mode" is available, but the most significant advance in this version of the classic game is that it allows up to five players to compete at once. The "Battle Royal Mode" allows competitors to challenge one another in the classic Bomberman setting and a "Custom Battle Mode" let's players tweak the options and settings to their liking. As frantic as a good single-player game of Bomberman can be, five people playing on the same screen can increase the frenzy exponentially. Features: Play alone through 50 stages or compete with friends in "Battle Royal" or "Custom Battle" Take on a variety of monsters with their own abilities and personality Defeat your enemies in various single-and tag-team battles</desc>

		<desc>Pinball is a type of arcade game, usually coin-operated, in which points are scored by a player manipulating one or more steel balls on a play field inside a glass-covered cabinet called a pinball machine. The primary objective of the game is to score as many points as possible. Points are earned when the ball strikes different targets on the play field. A drain is situated at the bottom of the play field protected by player-controlled plastic bats, called flippers. A game ends after all the balls fall into the drain. Secondary objectives are to maximize the time spent playing (by earning "extra balls" and keeping the ball in play as long as possible) and to earn free games (known as "replays"). Elemental Pinball is a pinball game that features 3 different tables (Disco Round, Sea Round &amp; Jester Round) each of them with their own music, a good ball movement and the posibility of adjust the number of balls (lives) and the ball speed.</desc>

		<name>Gex : Enter the Gecko</name>
		<desc>"Is it just me, or am I engulfed in flames?" is one of the many one-liners uttered by Gex, a wise cracking gecko who should check himself into television rehab; he's addicted to it. After saving the Television Realm from the evil Rez in his first adventure, the gecko was ready to kick back, relax, and watch a little television. Little did he know his adventure was just beginning. One day, two secret agent goons showed up at Gex's doorstep. They inform him that Rez is back and looking for vengeance; the evil monster is planning to destroy the Television Realm once more...and possibly the world. When Gex tells them that he's retired and doesn't care, one of the goons hits the gecko on the head and takes him to a secluded place. When Gex comes to, the mystery men plead with the gecko to take the cash and help destroy Rez for good...or at least make him disappear. With that incentive (the cash), the wise cracking lizard slips into his special agent suit and plunges headfirst into the Television Realm. Watch out, Rez -- Gex is back!</desc>

		<name>Walt Disney World Quest : Magical Racing Tour</name>
		<desc>Walt Disney World Quest Magical Racing Tour boasts more playable characters than any kart racer before it (a total of 13 are offered), and each of the game's tracks allows you to maneuver a different vehicle. Instead of being confined to just a go-kart, you'll get a bobsled, or a rocket ship, and several others. Collect a myriad of power-ups to your vehicle such as Mickey coins which allow you to race a little faster with each additional coin you collect. Or use the guided bottle rocket to get a speed boost and home in on your opponent. You can also collect items that can be used against your opponents like the frog spell, which will leave them hopping in your dust. Or launch an acorn at them and send them flying out of control.</desc>
